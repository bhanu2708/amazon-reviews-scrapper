Only one drawback is that battery capacity is not 6000mAh. But I can say it has a good battery life. If you want to buy a new smartphone below 20k I will assure you to go for it. Camera quality is also superb. If you ask me about heating issue, it upper body gets somewhat heated if you use camera for long time (more than 25 minutes approximately, this is only mine experience) but not as other smartphones. I have mentioned all the issues over here. I haven't find any other issue. Software is also working properly. I hope this review will be helpful for you while purchasing this budget smartphone.",

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",

Lets you switch on the display without pressing any button. This increases the life of the power button.+ Good grip and round edges, feels good to hold the phone.+ Fast shipping, got it within 3 days.- Average camera in low light.- Display is too long and less wide, so youtube experience is compromised for full screen.- Default wallpapers have very low resolution, makes you fee the display is not good.- Battery is 6000 mAH but the backup time is only marginally higher than my 3000 mAH Samsung J7.- When I opened the packaging, the phone was already in switched on position and some extra apps were already installed. There was a small single scratch on the display as well. So do not expect a fresh piece when you order.- Annoying UI that will take time to get used to. Samsung should have opted for stock Android.",

It is really good at this price point)Camera - 4.5 on 5 (Quad Cam setup at the back produces nice daytime images, in nights the images tend to loose a bit of the quality, but that's okay at this price)Battery - 5 on 5 (It's monster battery really lasts long even with heavy usage, It lasts some 2 days for me on a full charge. It takes some 2 and half hours to charge this monster battery, this should have been supported with a 25V fast charger)Body - 3.5 on 5 (Look and feel of the phone is quite premium, though nothing special in it. The glossy back lets the phone down as the back is quite slippery and prone to scratches and finger prints. Must buy a good back cover to protect the phone from slipping from hand)Performance - 4.5 on 5 (The phone is quite good in performance as the UI is very smooth and there are no noticeable lags while using it. I have some 70-80 apps on the phone and the phone runs smoothly. With graphics intense gaming such as Asphalt or NFS No limits phone tends to heat a little bit.)Is it worth buying? Absolutely yes... Given the features at this price point this phone is absolutely worth the every penny.However if you have a little extra budget, would advice to go for Galaxy M31s.Thank you,Ashish Malkar",

        "body": "I have lost track of the number of mobile phones I have used since 2001. However, the best one I have owned till now is this Samsung M31. I have been using it since August this year. It has the best display, no dry eyes and the colours and clarity so perfect.Photos are awesome and no matter how quickly I click they all turn out beautiful. All my previous phones were unable to capture the correct colour of my dresses but my Samsung M31 gives the exact colour and if needed I can use any filter.The battery lasts all day no matter how much I use the phone and it charges quickly too.  The fingerprint reader is smarter than my previous phone's. It opens my phone instantly, no need of pressing hard or fumbling around and I am so grateful for that.There are minor features which makes it so easy and friendly to use.. like, the folders which I use the most is displayed at the top in internal storage. When you touch the App Overview, it shows the open Apps as well as the App which you frequently use but is not open now.The Notes App is the best you can find in a mobile. You can use numbered items and text matter in the same Note which is so cool when you are saving recipes or anything similar.You can change the colour background of in-built Apps and customise the display of the Apps on your Home Screen.There's an option to never display notifications on the Lock Screen. So after downloading a new app even if I forget to turn off notifications, my Lock Screen is always clear, displaying just a beautiful picture.What I like the most is this phone knows my methods and style and it has personalized itself to suit my needs without me having to do anything.Overall, my Samsung M31 mobile is the best product that I bought from Amazon. Thank you Samsung and Amazon. Keep up the good work.",

Only few queries like camera is not that good under low light conditions, Exynos 9611 processor which is kinda outdated but good for medium users.",

Unnecessary notifications from Daily hunt and other galaxy Apps..very annoying (no easy way to switch of these notifications either)Also suddenly camera says \"scan\" instead of working on a click (difficult for Senior citizens)The Samsung headset used also picks up noise while doing recording on Apps like Smule and Star maker - no good DSP and Headset tuning seen like in Redmi or other phones which have adjustments based on headset typeI verified the same headset on multiple phones like Redmi, Vivo etc and it works well there, but picks up noise in Samsung M31",

Though it is not up to the mark of 64MP. At highest resolution you cannot use the zoom to take the pictures. Sound quality is clear but could be louder. Not a heavy device. Wifi connectivity is fine. Display is superb. Speed is fine but sometimes lagging make you feel that for 8GB RAM it could be better. I connected my 1TB hard drive to it and it had no problems to read it. Transfer of files can be done with OTG pendrive or external Hard drive. Fingerprint reader works fine but face reader is not that sensitive.At the end I would say that with its pros and cons, you may go for it.",

My nephew downloaded a couple of high storage games and the phone delivers on that too.All in all super happy on making the right choice.",

Being a student I have used this phone for houres and only kept on charging at the 2nd day after being fully charged.It takes around 2.5 to 2.9 hours to get fully charged.2 Camera - camera is really really good and does its job in truly exceptional way it also does support 4K video recording being a youtuber I really like the camera, front camera is also the same which have high resolution but during the night you could face some drops.The amoled screen is one of the best and is really catchy the colours seem to be clear and really natural.And many more features if you switch from low end and phone you will experience a whole lot difference with this device.The only problem which I faced, is - during the update,  phone gets heated up.It takes 2 to 6 mins to cool down.And no more further problems were facedBeing a student I have a very high usage on this phone I mainly use this  for my work and for my studies I do not use it for games so please do not consider my review on bias of gamesBut the features reamain sameIt is one of the best deals i have ever hadFor professional use i give it9/10 😌Really happy with the purchase",

But the without the HDR function all the photos looked over exposed especially the sunlight. After the one ui 2.1 update we could not set HDR manually.The main drawback of 64MP is lack of details. But it manages to take good ones. Comparing to Sony 64MP Sensor the Samsung is very much lacking in Details and HDR function never works in 64MP mode.Normal Video Recording is strictly  restricted to 30 FPS. We could not even change it using other camera apps.Slow motion (240FPS) is having some freezes randomly.Super slowmotion is working fine (480FPS) and recording only 1 sec but excellent.Front Camera is just fine, cannot say its good because it also lacks very much details.About the Battery :Battery is very good.But comparing to 5000mah phones, its performing same as these phones.sAMOLED will consume more battery if white light is produced. So we could ignore the difference between 5000 and 6000.About Display and UI :AMOLED has its own drawbacks and some prosUi is clean and smooth.Amazon done their job correctly 👏Delivery was perfect in this Covid 19 pandemic",

Charging is pretty fast (thanks to the 15 W charger) takes around 1.5 hours to completely charge from 15%4.) Camera quality is great, stable mode is the best I had great videos with it.5.) Loudspeaker is actually very loud, much louder than other counterparts in the same range.6.) And how to forget about the display, which is just awesome; AMOLED panel with great colours and very high brightness.Cons-1.) Fingerprint scanner could have been faster, though it does the job well.2.) Camera is locked; can't install Gcam mod without root.Rest I feel the phone is pretty good, can't go wrong with this one, a great choice in this price rangeAnd obviously samsung offers great service, so that's a bonus.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.",

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.",

Battery is damn good and long lasting, I have  done 4 hours of gaming and still the battery was left by 50%.Cons:- At this price point they should have given a 33W fast charger and specifically a Qualcomm snapdragon 730G processor the exynos is lagy and out dated you will fill frame drops and lagyness in high end gaming. If you like high end gaming than this phone is not for you.Conclusion:- A great package with excellent display,camera,UI but 18W charger and exynos processor is little bit of disappointing.

The display is best is the market battery life is fantastic as you can imagine with 6kmah battery.",

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.",

This amount advertisement greed is unparalleled in the 6 Samsung phones i have bought over time including Note.

        "body": "Swarup Saha Verified PurchaseHONEST M31. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31 for more than four month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite U display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.1,309 people found this helpfulHelpfulReport",

I thought there was a problem in the charger. But then I changed the charger and it still won't charge. The phone started to drain out battery and then suddenly died. No charger of the same cord would help. It was a shame and a disappointment.I went to all the stores in near 20 km but all said due to Covid nothing can help. I am having a hard time to deal with this seeing that one cares about it. A pathetic service and leaves off my trust from Amazon and Samsung. I thought Amazon would replace it from home service but nothing seems to help.",

After that charging speed use to increase day by day.Now its getting charged 1% in 1 min.which is fine. But i could not get why my phone was not getting charged properly in the initial days.The second issue with my set is with the microphone, it also gets fail to show consistent good voice quality. My voice to the other end gets slow anytime.Even many of my friends got sets with different issues ( like corrupt display and phone do mot getting switched on )Camera is pretty nice, the strength of Samsung sets.However, based on such points i will not recommend anyone to buy this.",

This is such a bummer... lower part is normal but, the upper part just heats up!! If games like Genshin Impact or Fortnite or other games like that, then sorry, this one's not for you pal.. But, I loved Samsung Game Launcher though.. It's Samsung x Discord partnership is awesome! Other than heating, I found that the charging speed is extremely slow!! Its Soo soo slow!!

I purchased this Samsung M31 on __17th_sept_ its been just __23_ days and believe me i take care of my things like they are very precious. Always have. Today i had left my phone to charge and a few minutes later when i checked, the screen appeared to have a crack across the screen. As if it expamded from the inside and broke. The whole reason i purchased this phone was because the old phones screen broke. I could have simply got it fixed  but i didnt. Now when i try to get it replaced, the seller as well as Amazon are directing me to the manufacturer. It hasnt even been a month and it hurts to be treated this way after all the business i have given the company and its sellers.",

However in this price range it's very good for daily use-Charge time takes upto 2 hours but it increases battery life compared to other fast charging phonesSo, my overall experience with M31 is really very nice. If you are want to buy a smartphone for daily use, you can go for it. If you're a heavy gamer this phone is not for you because Exynos cannot handle heavy games as Snapdragon processor.",

It does not not show me my apps. The third reason is that some games like 'Call Of Duty', etc, Do not work on my phone. It might not be a high end phone, but some non-high end games that I have tried to install on my phone, install properly. But as soon as I try to open them, they go to a blank screen for a second, then reverts back to the screen I tried to access the game from.

Particularly, when I make video calls, the phone overheats so much after about 15-20 min that it shuts down the application!(2) Fingerprint reader was pretty good initially but after a few months, it does not work smoothly. Nowadays, I find myself opening the phone through the pass-code about a third of the time.(3) Too much bloatware and random software being installed whenever there is a system update.Had no issues at all with my previous Sony and two Honor phones, all of which worked smoothly for years. Goes to show, should never buy the crap that Samsung puts out - have seen many other phones of Samsung also have issues.",

My phone's display screen got damaged on it's own without any damage to the screen or body of the phone. It started with a small pink patch at the bottom and then started spreading day by day. Went to service center but they said it's not covered in the warranty and demanded Rs. 5000 to change the display.The battery life is also not good as per the MAH which is 6000. It hardly lasts for 1 day. The charging time is also very long. I had Mi Max 2 earlier whose battery was 5300 MAH and that lasted for more than 1.5 days with the same usage. So battery life is not as marketed.The camera quality is very good given the price range.The fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't work.",

Contacted Samsung and they told that it cannot be replaced but has to be serviced.  Handed the mobile to their service partners.  After a few days they came back and told they don't have the spare and hence they will give a Samsung Coupon which can be used to buy anything at their Samsung Store.  This whole episode took more than 14 days from the date of handing over the mobile to their Service Partner. I expected better service from Samsung but then looks like everyone is the same.",

Had a difficult time to return this since Amazon's return policy for phones is not great even if phone is faulty like this. Considering that phone as such is Ok with decent build quality, a nice screen and decent camera, I would assume Samsung would have cut cost by relying on some cheaper (read bad quality) parts and probably that could be the reason for this. I also find similar complaints on internet of battery bulging for M31 models. Another let down was the screen size. That's not samsung's fault though. All manufacturers claims 6.5 inch screens now. But a phone with 6.2 inch with an aspect ratio of 16:9 is much larger than a phone with 6.5 inch with say, an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Basically, all manufacturers are marketing with 6.5 inch screens whereas in reality these are in effect a near 5.7 inch size. So, if we need big phone, please watch out for aspect ratio, and specifically display/phone width, apart from screen size.  (That anyways is not Samsung's fault)",

I have been using this phone for three weeks and the earphone jack and the sound system is done. I handled it with care and I have never dropped it. But sound comes in high frequency , even when I plug in the earphones I hear nothing. It almost cost 18000. I was using Huawei honor 9n for 2 years my old phone never failed me. I thought this phone could be better but it is a waste of money. The only thing that it is better than my old phone is the screen and memory. It has stupid software. No inbuilt screen recorder, the camera is fake and it is too slow. Amazon gave only 7 days replacement I even regret buying it from amazon since flipkart gives a longer return period. I will never buy Samsung items again and I will never use amazon.",

I got this for my close relative who reported unbearable heat while keeping the mobile near ears as well as while charging the mobile. You can't touch it. Got it replaced from Amazon who are really customer focused and arranged a replacement quickly in this pandemic period. The replacement one which is also new was just ok for heat while talking but you can feel it is still getting heated while charging. My relative did not want for replacement once again as he badly needed the phone and said he will live with this negative. It is clearly a design issue which Samsung should seriously review to come out with features (liquid cooling?) to dissipate the heat. Otherwise the product & parts will quickly wear out / weaken due to prolonged and continuous operation under elevated temperatures and reduce the life. By solving this, Samsung can definitely promote this model well in the market and capture good market share.Thanks to Amazon for quick support to get the first one replaced.",

It has a humongous battery capacity and therefore you may easily pass a day without charging if you start the day with around 80% battery life. It's finerprint sensor works fine but situated a bit higher than the sweet spot you may say. It's camera quality is just average. It's display is just awesone,with super amoled and fhd,hands down, it's the best in this price segment.One thing that needs mention is it disgusts me that Samsung Galaxy M series phones do not come with good built quality like they just give plastic or polycarbonate back. Hopefully they'll improve in near future.P.S.- I bought it as a gift and she liked it.",

Now, I'm hearing every minute detail of sound, which I never heard in normal phones without dolby, of course your earphones also must be good enough to give the true output of dolby atmos. Battery backup is the most plus point for this model, which comes easily for 1 and half day with heavy usage in different ways. And blue colour of this model is very decent. No lag, smooth butter flow in working.There are too many options for camera in this, if u r a camera focused person. Perfect clarity of videos n photos.

Still they are not returning it somehow they want yo just replace that phn. I don’t know what gonna happen because i am not getting any other option its like i am trapped. But i just say i will never buy any product from amazon they are way bad in customer service and satisfaction policies. They are forcing me to keep that product which is not adequate in performance by just saying we are not having return policies.",

While talking to someone also, the phone auto restarts which is very irritating. Tried Whatsapp chat with samsung support team, didnt work and they suggested to go to the service centre. Service centre reloaded the software but that also didnt help. Now they are suggesting to change the mother board and keep the phone for 10-12 days. DO not expect this from a new phone from Samsung at all.  Read other reviews also where people have highlighted this concern, so its a chance that you might also get a defective product",

And some default functions that samsung has put are annoying ,like after every update there is an automatic installation of some apps that i don't want on my phone. Every time i have to delete them Manually. And the Samsung services , its like the customers have no choice their own, they have to take it otherwise this information will be a staple on upper bar of your phone(hope you get it).  Data used information or any other information sometimes its just impossible to get rid of it from there. Annoying enough.",

However M31 comes with a much bigger battery and a better camera both important features in my decision making. It's been a little over a month and I have no regrets. The phone is butter smooth in operation while I get a proper two day battery break up. The camera is sharp and produces amazing results. This is a phone for people who want a phone for basic day to day working. Emails calls browsing and reading selling with social media and watching videos all of it the phone does masterfully well. Gamers may not like this handset but they are a different segment altogether and this phone is not for that segment. I would recommend this to anyone with my eyes closed.",

Once charged, you can easily go with light usage - calls, songs , movies, photography etc.Display is really good with rich colours thanks to AMOLED. Samsung is known for its display.Camera Quality is awesome since 64 MP and 32 MP front camera.Only thing is it has Exonys processor so not suitable for someone into gaming.But if you are looking for a slim phone, this is not the one.It's far better at this point than Samsung A31 etc. I would say.",

Mostly you see connectivity and mobile signals issue while same sim and same network in other phone work much better.This phone is not built for gaming, multitasking, and heavy works. BTW i would say this phone is even not built for making phone calls too.I was so irritated by this phone that i sold this phone two times at almost half price within 2 month of purchase.Once the purchaser used for 24 hour and send this phone back to me saying same thing that this phone is not more than a garbage.",

The various draw backs are as:1.  The poor network receptor of this phone makes your calls getting dropped very often with lots of noise.2.  The camera quality does not do justice with this price range. Many other phones under 12K offer far better quality of camera. (However, 4k video is good for this one from noise reduction and stability perspective)3.  The fingerprint sensor is really pathetic and it fails many times.4.  The back side has started getting de-colorised.5.  The fingerprint magnet on entire screen puts really huge amount of spots which is again a big disadvantage.Good Side: The screen size and display are ok considering the brand of Samsung and such price.",

        "body": "What can I say! When the phone arrived I really loved it, it looked a little heavier than my last phone, but otherwise it was good.But then why this one star review!Few days later, the phone was accidentally dropped from a height of around 1 foot and the display broke. The phone would not turn on no matter what I would do. I decided to take it to the service center thinking that this would be covered under warranty, but they clearly said this would not be covered. The display panel would cost more than 5k and I would need to wait at least 7 days. Fine, I thought. Then I received a call letting me know that the part is not available, so they will give me a refund coupon after deducting the cost of the part thats not in stock. Okay. I got the coupon. The coupon by the way can only be redeemed at designated samsung stores and not everywhere. It is also not redeemable online. So, I went ahead and got the lesser mortal M21 deciding not to invest much in any other Samsung mobile phone. But seriously I have used Lenovo and Honor and Vivo in the past. Why would a mobile handset be so fragile in 2020! It reminds me of the time when first these kinds of smartphones were introduced and one had to be really careful. Not only that, I saw many people with M31 queuing up outside the service center. I don't think the present mega review online justifies the experience of many users.Parting questions -1. Why create such a fragile phone?2. Why no spare parts available? Does it mean there are huge complaints already?Dear Samsung, honestly I expected better.",

Thats better than other phone brands in same price range.. I got my phone delivered on time within 3days.. I was cautious when I saw the less packaging by Amazon..

He finds more easy to see things on display.Samsung UI also helps to enlarge the display icons and text. It can be a bonus to those who don't want to use spectacles.He needs camera which is decent for the phone at this price. Personally, I feel color reproduction can be better.The wide angle lens is plus. It helps to capture a lot in single shot.This phone is Made in India.This boosts our confidence and ensures that we support our Nation with this purchase.Questions are welcomed.

Tried all options,  but there is NO resolution from Samsung side. Finally they mentioned to factory reset. When did google search on this issue, came to know many users of this phone are facing the issue, and mentioned even factor reset also didn't resolve the issue.I did a blunder by choosing this mobile over Redmi Note 8 pro.It has many drawbacks compared to Redmi Note 8 pro.1) It is slower2) No volume when connected to car through Android Auto3) Before my media speaker stop working, facing another type of issue - media speaker volume drops suddenly after few seconds. Now it become totally dumb.",

But their services is extremely good...Well i bought a M30 s on 20.09.2019 and  on july 2nd week i got an update of Android 10 then after 2 months the random restart started . I tried to find the solution in the internet and most of the people are compiling about this in the Samsung forum (the official one) but I can't seem to find any reply from Samsung's side.... So i went to the local service centre at the situation of Covid 19 and they tested the device , told me that this phone has some mother board issue and they had replaced the whole motherboard. I am using now with the new mother board...(only 3 days been using) and i didn't find any issues in this MB. SO I SUGGEST TO SAMSUNG AND SPECIALLY YOU tech burner! Please tell Samsung to fix the software and these kind of cheap issue..we want the non Chinese phone in our hands.",

I didn't return it because I needed the phone. And within a month I dropped it and broke the display and unfortunately I had no insurance. So took it the Samsung service center in Mangalore.Pathetic service, after nearly several calls and emails I was give a coupon with display cost deducted since the display was not available.In the month I used the phone what I noticed is that Samsung had put in the 6000 mah battery bcoz the phone is a power guzzler.the battery backup lasts less than 2/3rd of a day with mobile  data on.Anyways,I like phone for its display and cpu.the Samsung coupon was offline one meaning to be used in store only for a Samsung  device purchase only..which meant i had to shell out 1000 rupees more than online prize,but clearly i got an unused brand new phone.",

And within a month the phone stopped working and I had to visit service centre which took 1 and a half month to rectify my issue that too when I lost my patient and decided to move to Consumer Forum. The most drastic experience I ever had.Now talking about the phone it is simply not worth the dont be fascinated by the add it is not anything like the advertisement.Battery is not fast charging.You take 6 GB or 8 GB after a while you will experience slang and hang up.Camera for name 64 but more equivalent to 12 or 16.Support worst nor the service centre or customer care will do it in time. All you will be getting is harassment . This is my experiences and I will urge and advice all my friends and family do not buy not only this but any Samsung product .",

I'll keep this short and to the point:Pros:1- smooth operation most of the time.2- camera is really good. Good modes, good clarity. Sizable upgrade from my old moto g5s plus.3- screen is good. No complaints.4- audio quality is good but could have been better5- battery is a genuine masterpiece. Lasts close to 2 days with very heavy usage and that's good enough for me.6- pleased that this is manufactured in IndiaCons:1- occasional stutters. I don't know why but occasional app transitions stutter and it can get annoying. It's not very common but say I swap between WhatsApp and Reddit while typing something, there is a noticeable stutter. Hope this gets fixed. Update: it has reduced but it is still noticeable2- fingerprint sensor could use some speed enhancements3- facial recognition is in my opinion it's downside. I don't use it much but it is very sloppy and inconsistent.4- NO IP RATING. I'm surprised that I overlooked this at the time of purchase, but this is a genuine let down. I can handle my phone well, but this can definitely screw with your usual usage if you are a rough user.All in all, phone does my daily activities well and I don't have too many complaints, but I'd have liked it if they fixed the stuttering and had added an IP rating.",

        "body": "Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...I wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.When we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!We had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑It’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!",

I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents, or videos & pictures as we required. As I am a Digital creator, I have to watch lots of work and youtube videos in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with also student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.",

I am unable to find any channel in Amazon by which I could register my complaint. Further while going to Samsung dealers in Jaipur i am getting all sort of excuses like the phone has defects and it is not covered under warranty as the damage seems of physical type. The other dealer is stating that the phone is defected and there is moisture in the phone.I am unable to understand that since I am using this phone there is no such damage that has happened and hence the problem exists as a manufacturing defect. Further, what is the kind of customer resolution been provided by Amazon for the person purchasing products through them as there is no provision of giving any complaint. Also Samsung needs to check the quality of products that they are offering and the service that is being provided by the dealers.I request for a response and action that may help in resolving my concerns.",

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.",

M31 rocks in this price segment with its display quality and relatively better camera then others. the camera quality is much better than others wrt to clarity and details it preserve and photos doesn't seem to be over saturated and edited like other brands do. battery is beast and processor is good. only one drawback for all samsung phones that it stops giving software updates within a year or so and hence people who are genuinely concerned with security of the phone are in the back seat. overall good buy.",

It is not that other manufacturers don't use such notches but no software optimization has been done to make UI appealing, almost always the display is asymmetric (content is not centered or notch is not hidden even when possible), even in apps like youtube... And about that software, not gonna lie, it is pretty bad, the processor itself is quite powerful (although heats up pretty wuickly in sustained loads like PUBG and COD), but UI stutters a lot, many apps malfunction even popular ones like Paytm (on a regular basis). Also the camera, oh my god, the camera is very bad, I am a person who doesn't use front camera all that often, but when I do the photos are soft and most of the time pretty terrible, my redmi note 5 pro had better front facing camera, it almost 70% fails to recognize my face, if you combine that with the terrible fingerprint sensor this has, you can take my word for it that 60% of the times you are going to punch in your pin. Rear camera (primary sensor) is just okay, nothing to rave about, all sensors apart from the primary are not worth using.Also there are ads in this UI too, baked right in the app drawer, oneUI or whatever they call it has dark patterns all around to trick you into opting into ads and all that bullshit.3/10 in my opinion.",

        "body": "Merits:The two best features of this new Samsung Galaxy M31 is that it has an excellent battery life and no storage problem as I opt for the 8 gb RAM & 128 GB memory.  In days when I use my mobile constantly and very much i.e. 8-10 hours the battery is expected to be exhausted on the next day i.e. after 24 hours. On the extreme end, when I use it for 4-6 hours per day than it would probably still continues to work fine for 2 days.The next feature every one looks for, is the camera it has 4 camera on the back and 1 in the front.  The camera can totally be used for my youtube videos and other stuff.The additional feature i.e. finger print reader works absolutely fine.De-merits:While taking videos, the camera can't capture the motion pictures/running objects. It becomes totally blurry.When I turn the on the slow-mo video option it doesn't give the good quality picture.Conclusion:Good for the college students, working people and youtuber as well who are looking for mobile phones in an average budget.",

After 30 days situation worsened. So it landed to service centre. Another story can be written on  experience with Samsung service centre. ( to mention one thing --Not single employee wears mask at service centre .. seems all are superhuman) .So  after using hardly for 30 days  it's gone to service centre and found issue with charging port. Brand new equipment with charging port issue??? What's next awaiting God knows.Now can't return it, as return period is only 10 days after purchase. So stuck with this now.Think well before investing hard earned money in this.Dikhave pe mat jaao ....",

Amoled Display is very good, you can't get this feeling on another brand phone as Samsung Super Amoled is best in class.3. 6GB RAM is more than enough.4. Samsung OneUI has a ton of good features, it is one of best UI out there.5. Speaker is good and clear but not much loud.6. Main camera is beast because of very good post processing, Night mode impressive,Ultrawide pictures are not sharp as resolution is only 8MP. Portrait mode is also very good. Macro lens is not much useful.7. Dolby atmos support through audio jack.8. No 60fps option in videoCons:1. Plastic body feels cheap2. No knox security and secure folder3. Exynos 9611 performance is good for basic usage but for heavy usage a big No!! Due to not much powerful processor after some time performance will degrade.4. No pro mode in camera5. 15W Charging is slow for 6000mah batteryAccording to me it is good phone from Samsung at this rate for people who are not in heavy gaming and other heavy task.",

Redmi as such offers the same or better quality in lesser price.5. Battery is a thuglife battery. Its not a fast charging battery and backup is not as per rated.My suggestion, samsung must stop loooking for too many features, better make it user friendly, customizable options and more smooth functioning, thats all users actually want",

However, no further setup was initiated (and no other damage or whatsoever).Ok, coming onto my problems with the phone.- The phone is fully plastic build and feels utterly cheap. (Considering the price point, I would not expect more. So , let's pass)- Another thing is the performance. I literally feel betrayed. The phone crashes when playing low end games like among us. Sometimes it needs to be rebooted due to this. And yes, talking about the reboot, the phone automatically reboots time and again (happened 6 times in 9 days).- The charger cable and the charger. Cheap Cheap and Cheap. It feels like a 90rs cable that you pick from a chinese shop present on the roadside.- Not a big fan of the huge bottom chin (It is just personal preference.).- The battery backup is on point and the camera is ok-ish.- The screen is also on par and I like it. I also like the One-UI from samsung.- The fingerprint sensor is snappy and is blazing fast.- The side buttons for volume and power are tactile and has good click to it.- And yes, kudos for the good old headphone jack.Atleast, now I know never to get a budget samsung product ever again.",

Macro is better than any othe phone.Battery:  Who has long usage. Fetches 2days battery life easily. ( But not suitable for hardcore gamers )UI: very light and we'll managed. Good in long run ( But not as good as funtouch). No lags at allSpeakers are fairly good.

When I took it the authorized service center they couldn't find any fault nor could I make them believe that this kind of  problem existed.  Any way, after resetting the device  by the service center, this problem seems to have been rectified.",

Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.",

Amazon will place you call on hold and hang it later. Samsung will tell you to reach service centre for a brand new phone. The option is get it from an offline store for better service and no risk.

Takes atleast 3 tries to get my fingerprint detected.2) cannot secure/lock apps. There is no inbuilt security for locking apps and app notifications. You have to download a third party app to lock your applications3) does not allow me to chose a sim while turning on the mobile data. You have to go the settings and change the default sim everytime you want to use another sim.(i understand this might be a weird thing to point out, but i use both my sims for internet based on the network connectivity. Hence this is a bit annoying)4) within the first month of using the phone, i experienced the error \"UI not responding\". Although i have not encountered the same error again, but it still says something about the performance of the phone.5)not happy with the battery life while using the normal mode. If the phone's mobile data/wifi is on, the battery drains quickly.Verdict : the phone is quite nice if your work is not heavily dependant on internet. With power saving mode, the battery performance is incredible. Go ahead with it if you want a budget phone with good camera, battery life and ram performance.",

        "body": "I bought mobile from amazon for my wife. She was was using it last one month. I was busy with my work and for some days out of station. Today my wife told that mobile is hanging frequently. I visited samsung service centre and they told that this is problem due to water. When i told that it never fell in water nor any water drops on it. They told this may be due tosweat or moisturiser. They are not accepting warranty period. My question is if no water, how this happened. If any water, why no single font of paper label attached inside and outside, affected. No changes in paper quality and even in font style, colour,etc. If really wet why is charging properly. Why no affect in charger, charging point, earphone connecting port and no symptoms in charging port outside. How water/sweat/moisturizer came inside without affecting anything. I think either samusung used defective parts in my mobile or seller replaced it. If not seller fault, why samsung is designing such design for mobile where sweat or moistrizer may come inside and they dont write in warning/notice section. Is their design such worst and keeping space in mobile so that water may come inside without affecting other things. If really this problem, this is also manufacturing defect. I file complaint with customer care but no positive response. I am thinking to file complaint in consumer forum making party Samsung India, Amazon, Seller and their service centre. Please dont buy this phone with this seller until surity with  Samsung, seller or Amazon for further service. God know who's fault but 18000 rs loss for me. I am using samsung for many years but i faced such type of problem twice. Now i decided if they will not repair my phone, i will not buy any samsung product in my whole life....",

Battery life is not as good as expected (you can pull off one day without charge if you spend 60% time of your work hours on phone)2. Face recognizer is extremely poor3. The phone is bit heavy as compared to others I have used so farIn overall terms, i will give 4.5 stars to M31 and I guess it will be a great phone for anyone who wants to try Samsung phone.",

I am Feeling like Cheated,I ordered the Product on 7th Sep 2020, It was Delivered by 10th Sep 2020As soon I received the Phone delivery, within couple of hours I had recognized that there is some problem with Phone Camera...Thu, Sep 10 2020, 7:41 PM (Delivery Day) : I had registered my complain on my Amazon Account, also tried to Connect with Customer service on Call,  The guy advised me the Factory Reset Option, I followed his instruction but it didn’t workedFri, Sep 11 2020, 2:30 PM : Next Day I again called the Customer Service, she instructed me to install some service app on the ordered mobile, Since I was not carrying the new mobile with me so I tried to call next daySat, Sep 12 2020, 9:40 AM  : I Called the amazon Service, The Guy told me that he needs to check the actual cause of problem, for this I need to install some app on my new mobile so that it can scan and find the problem, so he instructed me to install “minspect” app, this app failed to recognise the fault, then he told me to download “Blancco” app, I don’t know whether it worked or not but after few minutes he told me that he is arranging Technician visit, the Technician will come and inspect the Phone, Available Tech visit Slot was on 15 th Sep 2020 after 2PM, I found myself comfortable with available Slot so the visit was Scheduled, I was supposed to get an email one day before the Tech Visit with Contact details of Technician, But I didn’t get any confirmation by Mail or over Phone…Tue, Sep 15 2020, 2:50 PM : No details, No Calls No SMS and No Tech Visit - When I called the Amazon Service He apologised for the Best Service of Amazon, He arranged the Next Visit on 17 th Sep 2020, I requested him an E-Mail Confirmation about the Scheduled Visit, but he refused to confirmed by mail (System me koi problem hai sir), and noted my registered number with a promise  that he will call me on 17 th sep 2020 by 5 PM to enquire about my complain!!! He also promised me (On Record) that If Second Tech Visit is also not happened then Product will be returned since it is the Policy of Amazon that they never go for Third Tech Visit.Today 5:26 PM (17 Sep 2020) : No Tech Visit, No Repair, No Return – Today when I called the Support, It was really surprising to know that No Tech Visit Was scheduled, She told me that since I have not received any confirmation by mail so there was no such visit was scheduled, But when I argued that Amazon Service guys had confirmed me Two Visits on Record, She told me that no such Visits found on Record… any complain will not be registered unless a Technician inspects the Phone, So I am not left with any option but to rely on Amazon Support, She Registered my Request for Next Tech Visit.Product can be returned by 18 Sep 2020, and Next Tech Visit is on 19 Sep 2020 (confirmed by Mail and by SMS)!!!….I just want the Problem with Devise has to be addressed. Amazon Service Team has ruined all my hopes, I am Still carrying the Faulty Product SAMSUNG M31 , 64 GB, 128 GB with 64 Mega Pixel Camera (Which is not Working)I had spent about Rs. 17,500/-, my energy to get connect with Service Team 5 to 6 times and Tons of Mental harassment,I don’t know for how long this review will be here, only reason to post this review is that I hope Amazon will look into the issue and will improve their Service.Guilt of being cheated by Amazon will be with me for long. I have learned a lesson…. Thanks Amazon!!!",

I showed that other  phones  from other  brands have better call  volume  but they informed we can not compare this phone with other  brands. Finally i came out of samsung service center  totally disappointed. Now i wonder  why i invested so much money  for this samsung brand. I shall  never go  for any  samsung phone in future.  Now i have realized  that a lot of complains are there on different forums on internet for low call volume in this model.i do  not recommend this  phone to anyone.Naresh  GuptaInvoice No : IN-SLKA-121325Invoice Date : 14-aug-2020",

File size for single file is showing 25 mb but quality  of picture is not good.3. Face lock sensor  is also  not working  properly.  Some time it works or some time you have to use finger lock.4. Phone processor  is slow as compared to SD series.Total  waste  of money. Please consider  other phone in this price range.Regards,BSB",

You will feel cheated by buying it.2) Display is very bright and not at all adaptive.3) Even adjusting Camera in it's best settings quality of photos is not good.4) Its interface and customization is far behind compared with any of same range mobile. Example Signal strength of the mobile network in the notification will never show you the correct picture. Even if you remove the sim card notification shows full Signal strength.5) Internet data speed status is not available in the notification. Even after enabling its settings it doesn't show in notification.6) Taking screen shots just by moving palm is very difficult in this mobile.7) interface is very poor compare with other mobiles.8) Samsung may be good in high range mobiles but not at all recommended in the mid range.9) There are many more points to write but the touch pad is so irritating that it kills the interest of writing or touching the mobile.10) Samsung services as we all know how it give the service to its customers.11) Finally I do not recommend to buy the Samsung mobile in mid range better go for another brand instead of Samsung. It is worst brand and selling worst products.",

More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?",

I was shocked to see that, it could not even sustain little height falling. Screen got cracks and its display went dead. Samsung design is questionable in durability. If government is compromising on quality of Make in India products, then God save this country. I know nothing will happen. I have to shed from my pocket. My MI phone fell from even more heights, but nothing happened. Still working and writing this review from MI A2 phone, which I kept as a spare one.",

Front camera doesn’t seems like your using one of those picture enhancer app(youCam), I understand that’s for good looking self portraits but they seem like Photoshoped by amateur!! But the rest seem great!! Back camera is excellent, macro lens is great, Display awesome, Samsung UI is smooth and reliable, performance is good too.

To my surprise, i find even the front camera is capable of 4k video. The battery lasts a day for heavy usage and for a normal usage, it would go almost a day and half. In terms of memory, this is a 6GB, 128GB model and therefore the best one can ask for in this price bracket.",

Hence 2 stars.I was not sure on the processing fees for the loan, but when I checked my bill it came 99/- charges as processing fees. Please am not sure if this was mentioned in the T&C. Totally not satisfied with the billing this time.The bank said that processing fees if from Amazon side, so they must tell upfrontly what charges they would be takings.",

Second is when i switched on my phone it gone to the boot page and i was shocked but it isn't a problem  at all so don't worry3.the third thing is, your phone will discharge a bit faster for the first four days and it's  normal and you don't need to think about any return or replacement of your phoneSo, finally the review>The phone's camera is very good>The phone gives screen on time of around 10.5hours>this phone's display is marvellous,  right from viewing angles to brightness and clarity of the phone>the performance is very good in normal usage and about gaming i don't know because i don't play gamesThank you for reading my review",
