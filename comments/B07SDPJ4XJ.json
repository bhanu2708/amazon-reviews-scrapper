Discharge of battrey is good because of 11nm chipset so kinda helps in number of times you will charge.Canera quality is ok, not the best but does justice to the price.Definitely recommend it to others if you dont mind 2-3 hrs charging time.",

        "body": "I exchanged this for my Redmi Note 4. All said and done, I think, I shouldn't have. The Redmi Note (4 or any other version since) is superior in every way - scores over the Oppo in both departments  - hardware and software. I would have bought the new Redmi 9 but it wasn't available for exchange and I wasn't about to pay 4000 more. Besides there is the Redmi 9 and then there is a Redmi Note 9 and both offerings use the Mediatek processor, this time over, if I am not mistaken, instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon, and it is early days yet - with the reviews. They say some flavors of the Mediatek are doing as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon, but I can't be sure and you might want to look up the data on that elsewhere - say NDTV gadgets or some such site.The Oppo's operating system \"Color OS\" sucks big time. Among other annoyances the most visible / obvious ones are : you don't get that slider to get past the screen saver, and you have to punch in your security numbers every time - which is a bit of a pain and also they want you to pay them anything in between 24 to a couple of hundred bucks for a new theme, which you can get on other phones for free (or at least I did with Redmi). Who in their right mind will pay for kitschy wallpaper and cheap fonts from when windows was launched in 1985 (you know the type that was included in all kinds of \"banner\" software and then made it's way into software like wordstar? that). Also, from day one, the \"assistive ball\" is missing for me. I would use the assistive ball to take screenshots or the one-touch turn off display button. I tried to reach oppo customer service about it. try as I might, i couldn't call them and then I found an email id and tried to write to them, but they didn't have an answer either. The best they could do is ask me to reset the OS all over again - which of course I am not going to do. It would mean downloading and installing all the apps again. And if it still doesn't correct the problem, I'd have lost all that valuable bandwidth for nothing. Also, it would reset some of the bloatware I got rid off, so painstakingly.  I can always use the system one touch turn off display icon from the tray. But shiver me timbers! if I ever need to reach them about a genuine SOS kinda issue, then what?!The other thing that you miss when moving from the Redmi to this one is the Redmi OS's \"Second Space\" feature. The dual device mode (not the same as dual apps). It's like you have a laptop / PC with two operating systems to choose from only you can switch from one to the other when your phone is still on - fully booted up and while working on one OS. Like an alt + tab on the PC, switch from one \"space\" to the other and back again. Talk to the wife on the one end and exchange whatsapp with the girlfriend on the other (kidding. have neither a wife or a girlfriend! but think about those who do! what fun! yeah? they made a phone for adulterers!).I tried to take a picture of the full moon at night the other evening, and all I got was white light in the frame! Now, the thing has four cameras, with goodness knows how many megapixels and it's been a while since smartphones have been at it - so, you'd think they might have the whole point-and-shoot thing in the bag, wouldn't you? At least don't dissolve a perfectly round moon into Jesus' second coming! Elsewhere I read, the OPPO isn't what you use for night photography, but it takes okay enough pictures during the day. But that's like shortchanging you 50 percent on the cameras. It's like they punched in four holes in the thing and stuck in a few lenses that don't do nothing ever for you, like a cheap Rolex knock-off that sits there on your wrist, but won't tell the time.  I don't use the camera, so I won't complain, but you don't want to buy the Oppo to take pictures then.I had a good mind of returning it and get my money back before the window closes but I don't want to go through the hassle all over again (of buying another phone). It works and I am able to use it to connect to the internet. I can only hope that the thing does not develop any snags going ahead and at least lasts me a few years before I can afford to buy me another phone!so, yeah. underwhelmed. but on the plus side, i knocked Rs. 3500/- off of the marked price, got me a little more space (the old Redmi had 32GB and this one has 64, not that it makes a difference to me. A good chunk is taken away by the OS and leaves about 40 GB available to me for my apps, audio and ebooks) , and also I got me 4gb of RAM. That's a GB more and the good thing about that is I don't have to start the Amazon app again every time I go away googling for the answers to the Amazon quiz. (what? so I cheat! it's not like I have won anything ever or am ever gonna win anything anyway!)",

Speaker and sound is absolutely best, dolby atmos is amazing to hear, there are two speakers on this phone.3. Quad cameras, there are four of them in the rear and they take decent photos for this price range.4. Android 10 update with dark mode looks awesome along with colorOS 7 UI.5. Display is very good inspite of being only HD plus display.6. Snapdragon 665 can run most games at medium settings without any problem.Cons1. No fast charge, it will take around 2 hours to fully charge this phone to 100% from 10%.2. Screen resolution should have been Full HD and many of the completitors are offering it at this price.3. Front camera not as good as you would expect despite being 8 mp.",

For the price I paid I am very happy with the product as I have found the camera and the audio very good. The screen resolution could have been better though for the size of the screen used. Have shared few images shot on the phone. The video stabilisation also seems to be good.  Overall its a very good phone.",

We should expect DSLR quality from Phone camera so My rating is 4.3) Charging is quite good and fast .4) Company is providing back cover and earphone so it saves Rs.500/- Earphone sound is very good and soft.5) Finger Sensor rating is 46) Using since 24 Hours and not fell any lagging. Installed my Office application and its quit good and Fast.7) Better than MI (Xiomi) because now these days MI comes in Sale and in few minutes it will finish , but I would recommend  for this no need to wait for sale and quite a good phone in this 12000/- range.8) Delivery took less than 24 hours and I am not a prime member- Credit goes to Amazon.Cons1) Ring tone is little bit low",

But Vowifi works inside also... So I purchased it for vowifi. Firstly I got annoyed as I didn't find the vowifi feature (though i checked in internet before purchasing) . But then there was a catch that only oppo 2020 having Color OS 7 have this feature and upgrades will be available for phones having build version ending with 48 and 51. This I came to know from Oppo customer care. Thankfully my phone was in list of updated ones and after updating it serves the purpose. Now I can make and receive calls even inside house. Weight Slightly on higher side but touch and camera are gud.",

Which my Dad is using from starting so it saved 200-300 rupeesType C charging is goodSize is great and light weight too",

        "body": "I have been using phone almost one month. I am satisfied. This phone is more good that what I have expected. Starting with camera ,it is only a average camera not bad but has 4k video recording. Battery life is excellent. I am getting 11 plus hours ON screen usage. Then the most good part of the phone is it's speakers and finger print scanner. Screen is not full hd only 720p but it's good . Phones design is perfect. In my usage of 1 month I haven't felt any lag even when I played Pubg. I can't find any dark mode on this phone. In my first impression the phone was a bit heavy. But after usng it I am used to it. Overall a good phone for day to day use.",

Front camera performance is above average. I wouldnt recommend selfie lovers.The video stabalisation of rare camera is like other phone in price segmant like redmi note 8.Battery: The battery is the beast . It lasts a day smoothly after heavy use and may even remiain after that.Performance: Its good . I wouldnt say its bestBut redmi note 9/note 8 is better in smoothness if compared. But its smooth.Pros(my point of view):1. Camera is outstanding for the price2. Speakers are extra loud and have good quality3. Screen is really large and colours pop out amazingly4. Fingerprint and face unlock are like flagship phones5. Design feels rich6. Phone feels light in handCons:1. Front camera could be improved2.the speed of scrolling is a bit slow( Im not sure, i guess it can be fixed through settings)3. Camera app could have more features like night mode",

I changed certain settings in developer options to make more ram free and bang performance of gaming improved drastically. This simply means this device has bad ram management and it really needs to ne worked out. I would suggest if you bare planning to buy this device with multitasking and gaming in mind than think twice, otherwise it's Ok to go for it.",

The camera is very poor. It has too much noise and picture quality isn't good.2. This phone doesn't support direct video calls. That's pathetic.3. Phone gets heat up and the charger heats up more than that. I've shared a screenshot of 43¬∞C but I've noticed the temperature going 45¬∞C. If you are using online meeting apps like zoom, ms teams or Google meet, the heating is little faster. The worse part is that it gets up heated while calling which makes it highly uncomfortable to talk and even hold in hands.4. Whatsapp notifications stuck on the screen for few seconds while watching online videos.5. You can't see YouTube videos more than 480p, sometimes a few videos stream at 720p. Same videos run at 1080p on other devices.6. The customer care executives aren't able to understand the problem. I've called 5 times since Sunday but they conduct and suggest the same solution for better performance of the phone but no improvements have been noticed. Yesterday I was convinced that Amazon has registered the problem and will get back to me but I'm waiting since yesterday afternoon and my query hasn't come yet.7. Amazon fools you. It decreased its prices on 6-7 August for sale. I was happy that this product is available at a lower price but the decreased price has become fixed now. So whenever you see a sale, always buy electronic products after the sale is over and don't become a fool. I bought this item based on my friends recommendations (since I needed a phone urgently for my work) but I'm done buying any electronic products from Amazon.",

It's user friendly and comes with decent headphones (design is similar to apple's) for which I was pleasantly surprised. For this price, Oppo has delivered a winner for sure. Go for it.",

Stereo speakers which are quite loud and great for such a cheap phone4. Dolby Atmos5. Two usable cameras incl. Ultra Wide6. 5000mah battery with type C charging (again quite rare at this price point)7. Android 10 update (rare for entry level phones)Cons:1. Ultra wide camera is lackluster2. 10watt charging support only3. L1 certification is only for show as Netflix and Prime do not support the phone for HD streamingIf you are getting it sale then it is quite a good phone, but if not on sale then there are better options out there from Samsung, Realme and Redmi.",

        "body": "Writing the review after using the phone for more than a week.‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èOppo A5 2020 is a decent budget range smartphone with Android 10(after the update) .Camera is good but definitely not the best. One plus point is that you get a pre-installed goggle lens which is a very useful feature .Battery is 4890 mah upto 5000 mah.Phone gets charge to 1% to 100 % in almost 2 hours. Battery works smoothly.Disappointed with its display which comes with HD+ display but not full hd+ display.I also received an earphone in the box which is good but it is of local quality and you will definitely find such earphone at 80 ~ 100 Rs in the market.The phone comes with a pre-applied screen protector with a transparent backcover.Coming to sound quality , the sound is just awesome because of it comes with Dolby stereo sound which produces 3D sound effects even in full voloume with crystal clear sound. Music lovers will definitely love this phone.The phone back has a good grip in hand with a glossy white rainbow finishing. You will love the rainbow efftect in your phone from the back if you ordered white colored Oppo A5 2020.Coming to gaming experience, it does the job. I have palyed both pubg as well as free fire in high quality and the game runs smoothly . Thanks to the game booster 2.0 provided by oppo which is really useful while playing games . It also comes with a feature of no notifications feature to avoid any disturbance while playing the game.It also comes with pre-installed screen recorder and long screenshot features which is really useful.Also , the last thing which I would like to mention is that it comes with lots of pre-installed Chinese apps. I would definitely suggest you to unistalled all of the Chinese apps for your privacy and data security purposes.Sugestion :-You can go with this phone if you a are a music lover who listens music at high volumes or most of the time on speakers .Gaming persons can buy this phone for average usage. But if you are a heavy gamer perosn, than please don't buy this phone because it does not cones with a fast charger which is definitely essential for a gaming person.Person with average use can go for it as it does all kinds of jobs at one place.‚úåÔ∏è",

Snapdragon 665 is decent for normal users, good for casual games but not for heavy games.  5. Has widevine L1 Certification, so u can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime In FHD.  6. Has Usb Type C, nice to have this.Cons - 1. Display is 720p, not a good display.  2. Doesn't support fast charging.  3. Cameras are too bad, for normal pictures it's also not good, don't even think about good shots.  4. Storage speed is slow, ram management is very poor.  5. Color os is not properly optimized.Extras - Fingerprint is good, supports reverse charging, has dolby atmos support,has gorilla glass 3, max brightness is quite good.",

BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that.but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming",

And the floating windows for multi tasking.On the downside, being adslr user,I was upset at no raw photo option for both cameras. Using 3rd party apps will give access to primary cam only with raw support. Hoping bbk will fix this.All in all very amazing little beast.",

It really protect the phone when falls down.Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently.Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day.Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all.I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.",

Gaaming is awesome , camera is not upto the mark, quad camera is just locha, night mode doesn't satisfy you,And the most important thing it lacks is the LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT it's a must and seeing it's price (13k) notification light must have arranged,I bought this phone in exchange don't buy it without exchange because you can get a much better phone in this price . nest with exchange",

Display is awesome3. Camera quality is good but you must have the knowledge of lighting to take awesome pictures.4. RAM 4gb and ROM 64gb is quite good for normal use5. Face recognition is very fast.Cons:1. Camera is not good for those who don't understand the lighting position. Only those user complain about it.2. Pattern lock is not available, you have to satisfied with face lock or numeric lock.3. Weight around 200gms.Overall a good phone with exchange and it will never disappoint you. Trust me.",

Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...",
