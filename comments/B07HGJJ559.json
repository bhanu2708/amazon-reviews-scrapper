Call Quality and Network Reseption is also great.5. Simple and Add free ONE UI (core one UI) 2.06. A Fab 20MP selfie camera with lots of preloaded filters for Selfie lovers and Screen Flash for night photos.7. Super Steady Video capture mode is really works well in outdoor Sunlight.8. Samsung Brand, Better Security and clean UI compared to devices available at same price like redmi note 9 pro, poco m2 pro, realme 6, etc....Samsung Compromised with These:1. Plastic Back.2. No Samsung Knox Security.3. Bass Quality is average even the Dolby Atmos available.4. Dolby Atmos work only when Headphones are connected.5. Camera stucks SOMETIMES when clicked on Back 48MP and Front 20MP.6. Super Steady Mode and SuperSlow Motion Requires Full Sunlight condition other tiimes videos comes too noisy and blurry.7. 4K, 1080p, 720p videos can shoot only 30fps no 60fps available.8. Exynos 9611 is capable to do Daily multitasking but not recommended for high Gaming it may cause Heating issue.**Better option for Gaming are 'Redmi note 9 pro', 'POCO M2 Pro' and 'Realme 6 and 7'.Overall a great Device, A really Grateful thing is A brand like Samsung has given soo much things at this price range.",

As a proof I've attached 2 photos along with this review... In which panipuri photo is from Samsung M21 which has top notch camera setup... This photo was clicked in full lighting but you can see light is almost missing from photo... While a photo of Fish was taken from Mi 6 pro which is way lower than Samsung M21 in specifications you can see the photo is full of light while photo was clicked in dark atmosphere !!!Dialpad and contact list are seperate, as I said MIUI dialpad experience is phenomenal you can reach the number you want to dial in very easily in MIUI where as in Samsung UI you need to struggle a lot to search a number or dial history !!!No inbuilt screen recoder, this might be a biggest thing you are missing in this phone !!!Phone hang up and Samsung relations still continued in this phone too... 45 GB out of 65 GB is free still phone hung a lot !!!Price drop in only 3 days after i bought this phone and still price drop will come in near future !!!Even Samsung not giving you phone cover or protector in boxOver all after using this phone for 2 Months I am not happy with this product !!!",

Superb Display3.Design:4/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 4/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers ..

Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 3/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 3/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low..

Certainly not a phone for Heavy Camera users or Heavy Gamers as the camera unit starts to heat the top side of front screen as soon as you start the camera and the rise is rapid and as for gaming processor issues. But if your uses are like me i.e. watsapp, facebook, google, WPS Office etc then this phone is awesome.The fingerprint reader is fast when it reads, but the slightest of dust or sweaty fingers and the reader just goes bye bye, but overall reliable. The battery surely is humongous and the backup shows. 2 days is no issue. As for camera quality the images are fine no issues as such just that there is heating issue. As soon as you start the camera the top side of front screen starts to heat, and keeps heating gradually and after the camera is turned of the temperature comes down gradually.I bought the phone because I wanted a no frills calling, browsing and social media device with lots of space and big battery. Plus the issue of privacy also was important for me. Samsung just felt relaiable then the chinese brands.",

I feel that's normal.Also there is no screen recorder or screen capture provided need to download it.I feel this is a proper and the best phone in this budget to compete all other Chinese phones.",

        "body": "If you are on a tight budget and looking for a phone that can pull off day-to-day tasks with minimal effort, Samsung M21 is the one for you. About three months ago, I have bought 6GB, 128 GB variant and my experience with this device is quite surprising I should say. What is exceptional in this device is its Super AMOLED display. Although Samsung displays are said to be the best in the business, it is quite generous that they bought this display into budget phone category which no other phone in the market in this price range offers. Exynos 9611 processor is not bad. It can pull of your regular tasks with ease and provides you a hassle-free experience. The major drawback however, in this processor is that it is not good for hard core gaming. However I have been playing big games like PUBG: Mobile and Call of Duty: Mobile for quite a while in this phone and I have observed some serious frame drops and stutter. In low graphic settings however, it performs well and surprisingly it gives you upto 45FPS! Battery life is good but not as good as I expected from a whopping 6000mAh capacity. It gives a typical 1 day under extreme usage and upto 2 days under normal usage. Camera is also pretty decent with good focusing, edge detection and colour reproduction. Samsung's image processing technology still needs a lot of improvements though (Time consuming). Talking about the drawbacks in this phone, we should first talk about the build quality. Samsung M21 comes with a plastic body which is way too sensitive to scratches and smudges due to a mere rubber or hard case. Ofcourse, it would be greedy if I expect a premium quality build in budget segment. But the quality of plastic can always be improved. The one most irritating thing in this phone is it's finger print sensor. If you're hands are just a little bit sweaty, you're a complete stranger to your phone. It's poor detection of fingerprints can be quite frustrating when you're in the middle of something and the phone doesn't open up. Apart from that, it's quite a good phone. If you are planning to buy Samsung M21, I suggest you to go with 6GB variant as the RAM management is better in 6GB variant that in 4GB one. Overall, this is the best phone in this price range with stunning display and surprisingly good performance and it is quite sad to see that this is the last phone in quite a lot of time that offers this sort of features including sAMOLED display under this price range. A definitely good value for money, indeed.",

If we play games, battery will last for surely 24hrs without charging and also camera doing well, it's having good night mood capturing ,slow motion and also it's giving good selfies!!!And good speed , and finally it's worth for ur money,u can go for it surely and the above all it's \"Samsung\" trusted brand, what else do we need?",

Be careful while booting the mobile. It will ask lot of permission to install 3rd party apps and to send data from you. Read every thing carefully and click continue or agree. Camera is extraordinary after I updated ( September patch) but I updated when I got my phone on October it wad around 1.2GB. beleive me the camera was extraordinary in this price segment and asusal the Samsung Exynos 9611....i won't say this is an excellent processor...but pretty decent for lite gaming..even you can play heavy games for 1-2hr. Not more than that it will get heat in the top side of the display where the processor is located. The battery backup I will say it's 5000 mah. Since Exynos is a power consuming processor when you compare to Snapdragon I will agree it will have the life of 6000mahBut it gives me 1.5 days backup for sure with 30-40% remaining charging speed is quite alot to be honest takes 2.5hrs for 0-100%.Overall good productThis is my first purchase through onlineAnd delivered very fast by Amazon.",

Clear and bright.- Fingerprint sensor is fast but sometimes it's not accurate.- Speakers are good, no problem during calls.- Charger takes more than 2 hours to go 100% from below 5%.- Processor is good, no heating during gaming. (I don't play games on regular basis)In the end, I will say if you are a normal user you can surely go for this. This phone is value for money.",

You can play all heavy games like pubg or other games without any issue.It has 128GB internal memory. So you don't need to buy an external memory card or daily cleaning of memory. But if you need you can expand it up to 512 GB. It is huge.6000 mAh Battery gives you freedom to use this phone for a long time. I charge it's battery in the morning once and don't think to charge it up to next day, even I use internet, enjoy music and lot of things which can drain battery quickly in other phones.Ultimately this is an extra smartphone and I am lucky to have it.",

Battery life is pretty decent and the fingerprint reader scores full out of hundred. I didn't feel the 'fast charging' as much 'fast' as expected.

If you keep Mi phones and Samsung, you will look now the difference-Camera is very good.No non sense camera and camera default app-Lot of customisation possible-No bloatware. Even the Samsung pre installed apps can be un installed. Compared to spamming Mi devices, this is lot betterWhat I don't like-Samsung UI is not so intuitive.You need time to get familiarise. Usability needs improvement",

I am a heavy user it goes nearly 24 hours of heavy use. 5-6 gaming 2-3 video 4-5 fb hours usage it can handle at a single charge. Camera:  Camera quality is not so good in potraits at a 2-3 meters range. All the camera effects and video effects are amazing. It can create random slow mo video at ease. Its the most fascinating feature though flash light is deeming while capturing. But in daylight its a master.Performance and Display: you can trust on android 10 with Samsung exynos that it can do hefty works in smoth way. Speed of internet is great. It can play pubg , free fire in medium and full display options. Easy ui interface. Sound quality is superb. Pro: battery, camera features, Ram , display, video watching, heavy uses, strong built, no heating problem, device care app.Cons: not water resistant, Camera zoom quality, weight, Camera capture time with flash, plastic back.",

Camera quality is good.4. Call quality is good5. In handfeel is so good without caseCons,1. Touch sensitivity is quite less after applying  tempered glass( maybe temperedglass is  not good)2. Cannot play heavy games as it supports  heavy games but cannot be played at good  fps.As a result this is a good phone for who is not very much into gaming. I feel this is good phone for elder people like dad and mom who doesn't play much games rather they consume some media and entertainment.This is a honest review writing after one month use.Ps. Pictures on this review was shot on another phone not on m21.",

Let me list down the pros and cons after 2months usagePros:1) super amoled full hd display @rs12,600 ( got it @ 10% discount in freedom sale 2020) must buy budget mobile if you are a movie lover.2)the \"48 mp primary camera\" is good captures all details with full clarity + dedicated memory card slot3) \"one UI 2.1\" is sleek with no bloatwares(you get a stock android feel)4)with humongous \"6000 mah\" battery it lasts more than 2 days in a normal use and it has 15W fast charger in box5)even with 6000 mah battery the weight is at \"188 gms\" and well balanced, easy to hold ( note:most 6000 mah phones are above 200gm)6)the processing speed is awesome with exynos 9611 combined with 4gb ram + one UI 2.17)widevine l1 certification+ dedicated blue light filter for reading+ DARK MODE for night usage+WiFi calling+ inbuilt \"FOCUS MODE\" that helps improve your productivity8) recently with new update you get the premium feature \"SINGLE TAKE\"( which is fantastic at this price range)9)even without macro sensor it does take some cool very close up shorts( attached a image)10)fingerprint sensor and face unlock is fast11)edge detection in portrait shots is commendable and you get to 4k video @ 30 FPS12)this phone has a \"very low SAR rating\" 0.468w/kgCons:1)the connectivity speed is slightly compromised for the low SAR value2)no tpu case in the box ( but that's not a big problem u can get one at rs 100 in market)3) speaker sounds are not too loud but if you use headset you have Dolby Atmos feature that gives wonderful surround sound.4) display speed 60 Hz and not 90hz, even the Samsung flagships run at 60hz in full hd resolutionI don't find anymore consMy verdict:If you want to buy a* cheap super amoled display phone*best camera with single take feature *run day to day apps smoothly with good gaming*2 day long battery life @normal usage* Best budget NON-CHINESE all rounderJust blindly go for this Samsung m21( 4gb+ 64 gb variant) in the Great Indian festival sale @ rs 11,699 ( with 10 % discount(rs1300 from rs 12999) with HDFC card....If you got it then is it \"VOILA\" for youNote: this is a review from my usage for 2 months which is fair and not exaggerated.",

Needless to say this is one truly amazing budget device which you get with an Amoled display and bigg battery. 8 have been using this device from quite a long time. The battery backup is amazing. The one that needs a special discussion is about the Amoled panel. The panel is very good. Bright with vivid colors. The processor is quite efficient with day to day tasks. There is even a game mode. The AR emoji with the recent update is wonderful. Gotta say Samsung is going to rule the midrange. This are the reasons why I bought 3 M21devices",

At this price it is the best budget phone available in the market for the moderate users.Weight is bit higher than expected as it is plastic body but weight is secondary matter so i am shifting from it.Camrea quality is at the peak as far as budget phones are concerned (except Oppo, VIVO).Triple camera gives depth and width in the picture and the color quality is also good.Fingerprint reader is as quick as other high budget phones.Bettery life is long lasting but the charging process takes bit higher time as company claiming the 15W fast charging. It is bit low from the mentioned value which is 6000 mAh.The brand Samsung suggest the quality of Screen and it is once again proven that samsung provides good screens.Also gadget have Update of Android 10.",

Since my father is average user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my father are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price .",

No adds very little blotware and loads of customisation features.. I am heavy user of phone and still always find something new about the phone features..- Processor (3/5): ok for the processor it's all right for regular use.. Also good for light mid size games but not for heavy apps and very big games for long time..Bad experience- i will be honest the only problem i got with the phone is network problem... The problem is not that big.. happens sometimes.. and i think the reason behind that is low bandwidth from the network operator and not the phone..So overall rating is 4/5 ... I am really satisfied considering its my first ever Samsung Product..",

Design In terms of design it looks plasticy but its hand feel is pretty nice. Back is not scrach resistant, will find scraches after using it without cover.2. Cameracamera performance is very good considering its price point, the photos will come in a very natural colour tone with good clarity.Wide angle shots are also good considering its 8 mp camera.Selfie shots are also very close to natural no extra beautification done.3. Battery Backup6000 Mah battery is huge and it powers my phone whole day easily but the charging speed is slow though it is a fast charging4. DisplayI feel its one of the best of best display in this price point. Colours are very punchy and contrasting, best for viewing media content5. ProcessorIts Processor is not that much powerful as note 9 pro but i did'nt find any lag in opening any apps. This processor can handle day to day tasks very easily.6. Extra featuresOne of the cool feature is that it comes with one UI 2 and some of the flagship features like always on display, AR emoji, Bixby vision.6. Some issuesThis phone heats up more than its competition even if you are not doing some heavy task.So this was my personal opinion on this smartphone. I think it is the value for money device which you should purchase under 14000.",

Had few issues in the beginning but with the recent update its doing even better job. Selfie shots are descent in outer conditions though struggles a bit in low light environment.Battery life is pretty descent with a day and half with moderate to medium use with data on and little bit of gaming. But with heavy gaming and continue usage if internet battery life is not as expect from a 6000Mah.There is absolutely no lag or slowness with multi tasking.Build quality is superb with very nice viewing angle thanks to its Amoled FHD screen! Does a pretty descent job in daylight viewing.Overall a complete package of features in this price segment. Recommended without second thought.",

Superb Display3.Design:4.5/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 4/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated..8. Charging :3.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 3/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamerGaming experience is not that much good butYou can play smoothly.It heats after playing 4 to 5 hours.",

OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It's Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Cons:1. One thing I don't like in it is it's cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.It completely good and satisfies me.",

Pros- smart slim looks, awesome display, touch function very smooth, great camera quality, user friendly camera features, processor os etc of latest versions, fingerprint reader working fineCons- Battery is problematic in terms of Charging time & Overheating. After using for one month I find that it takes 3hours or more to be charged full(from 8% to 100% it took 3hrs 10mins) everytime. I dont understand what is the point of giving a Fast charger then! Battery survives one 24-30 hours with moderate to heavy use, which is fine. But the charging time is too much. Also, it gets heated quite often if you have kept your data on, after few mins of turning off data it cools down. It may be possible I unfortunately received one product with problems, but, yes, my dissapointment over this one battery issue outdid its all other good features.",

Colours look very vibrant on screen and games look epic when I'm playing them on this phone.2) Camera quality is top-class. It takes a bit of time to focus on small objects but otherwise the photos look great.3) Battery life mentioned is quite misleading. Doesn't seem like 6000 mAh. I have to charge my phone almost everyday. I use it for minor gaming and listening to music. Maybe using Bluetooth headphones has that effect?4) You may want to wash your hands if you want to use the fingerprint sensor. If there is some dust on your fingertips then the sensor can't read them. Also try to keep the fingerprint sensor clean and dry at all times to use it properly.All-in-all, I would give this phone a solid 8/10.",

But with such high resolution pictures it's worth the wait.Finger print is the fastest I've ever used in a cell phone.During dark video calls never realised the need of front flash. Just increase the brightness and entire face is lit. Good brightness to the display in daylight as well.The display is massive and such great colours with a beautiful OS which allows optimizing almost everything.I've had the best gaming experience in this device no lags at all. Everything is so smooth and simple. The game management app is helpful.Weight distribution in this device is really good and doesn't feel like a phone with 6000mah battery.Dropped the phone multiple time on hard surfaces, and still it's working good. No scratches on the display.The speaker reminds me of the old China phones, Very loud but clear.In short this is a best buy at this price range for every type of user.P.S. it's IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh in images by m21 camera.",

In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer...CAN PLAY COD at low or medium settings without any frame drops ( little heating)8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer or minimal gaming",

Actually I m not using camera too much and also I am not so concern. But I clicked few nature photograph, colour combination is quite good.

        "body": "First of all I want to say that its value for money. I have been using it since 4th september 2020. Let us talk about what positivities it has and what are the negativities.Display - Wow! The display is just awesome üëå like just a typical smartphone. Perform any video with a huge enjoyment and clarity.Camera- The 48mp has a powerful detailing capability. You can see above photos and zoom them out for the better experience. The one ui 2.1 has typical options such as live focus or super slow mo..but it is not able to click good photos without daylight, Nightmode is there though. Selfie camera is a bit yellowish. After the device getting one ui 2.1, it has single take option which gives you better enhancement. Wide angle is also pretty good. There should hav been a macro lens.Battery- #wattamonster is not such a monster in battery. As you see in high end devices 4000 mah works, in this phone, 6000mah works as same. It has not long battery back up capacity. Still its enough for the day to day use. The charging speed is pretty slow, while normal charging it takes almost 4 or more hours to get 0 to100% charge, in fast charging through 15w in box fast charger it take a bit less time. Still the battery capacity is not that bad for a normal user.Performance- The exynos 9611 gives you enough power to play any game on it. Though there is a bit lagging issue while playing pubg. But it won't hurt your experience any more. Switich from an app to another, there is a kind of frame drop or lagging issue which can be removed after rebooting the device or keep it aside for a couple of minutes or more.The fingerprint sensor is quite fast than other samsung devices.So these were almost all highlighted problems and performances. Except all are moderate and good. Every device has pros and cons but m21 won't hurt your feelings and yes it comes with the branding of Samsung so no worries.",

This review is after use of four months.I'm not going for the specifications as you can read them up any time you want.The phone does have a good battery life, it lasts a day if you are a moderate user. The Camera is great and Samsung does have a lot of inbuilt software tweaks that enhance the experience. The Exynos chip can handle work load and the finger print scanner is smooth.If you can spent more then you can always choose the higher options, M31 and M51.It doesn't have the bloatware that comes with the phones in this market, and Samsung UI interface is good.",

The reason being  I use multiple apps at a single time, and I need notifs simultaneously from different apps. The huge storage was a welcome change as I'm not able to store multiple games.The game booster works well with temperature management but it's better to switch off at some intense moments as it messes with gameplay.The display is spot on with OLED Screen. Colours can be viewed in vivid and normal brightness.Both the cameras were competent in its segment but Samsung could have done away with the software to 'beautify' the images from front camera automatically.One drawback I observed was the signal strength. When two Sims are inserted it is absolutely necessary to make the second slot 2G if you want good network on the first 4G sim. The sim even works better when the second slot is unused.Battery life is mega. Even with Bluetooth and location on, the phone lasts a whole day.  Charging is 15KW, not too fast but not too slow either considering the charge capacity of the phone.",

Battery life is great but little underwhelming, it can do one and a half days easily, but never make it to the end of the second day, and slow charging.Performance is barely adequate. Lags if you mulltitask .Pubg plays fine, but occasional framedrops, especially when another squad is nearby ,or doing deaddrops. Not good at gaming.Camera is average, main sensor takes good photos, but focus hunting issue is there. Every other cam is just average.Weight is less and manageable. One ui works very well. But some  ads,bloat,spamy recommendations are there, but can be disabled for clean experience.This is a great phone to buy for your parents, for the millenials i recommend look into something with a bit more performance.",

I personally m not satisfied to a gr8 extent with the camera.i mean its not that bad but its not wow as well.. Its pretty good. But not Wow. Rest of the features are good. Battery life is also good . But i think with 6000mah of battery the charger is not compatible. Its olny 15w and takes time to charge. So my verdict is that is a gr8 deal. You wont be dissatified after buying it.",

And my review is based on truly improved Samsung M series with my best experience1.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount.2.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.3 SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.4.CAMERA.This time M series did a great job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 48 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high &  well lit captured shots5.BATTERYMain benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough for nearly 3 days continuously.So I highly recommend everyone who need a budget phone with high specifications need to buy this ..Worth for Money paid..",

        "body": "I use a single phone, with high usage of data transmission and data storage, and I also travel a fair deal. So my review may be more relevant for similar users.1. The phone battery goes on and on. Nearly never empties, except when I did not charge for 2 days. Normally, at night it is around 50% and I charge it back to 100%. This is really useful for travel in future, even if currently travel is restricted due to covid.2.  The camera does very competent job of still and videos. I am not a photo expert, so cannot comment on technical complexities there.3. I chose 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. While 64GB / 4GB would have been enough, regular upgrades of Android over next 2-3 years of this phones expected life may need more memory and having more storage also helps in keeping multiple email accounts and also music, pictures, ebooks etc,, without having to worry about phone slowing down due to lack of free space.4. THe display is very sharp and i have not found any difficulty in using it during day or night.5. Response time: The phone is very responsive, far more than the M30 which I used earlier. It has never kept me waiting.6. Connectivity seems very good - have not faced difficulty in wifi, bluetooth connects and also using as hotspot.7. I have two  - 4G SIM cards from different operators - and both work in 4G mode. Older phones allowed only one of the SIMs to work in 4G mode.Suggestion:1. Would like facility to have two users accounts defined under Android. This facility is available under Android but blocked by Samsung in this model.",

They are advertising it with gorilla glass but they are fooling people. My old motorola mobile is even better using that from last two years dropped it multiple times. But it's working great till now. Now they are asking for 5500 for repairing it.Cons-Too delicate screenInternet not works on 4G even in delhiSlow motion camera not works smoothlyToo thick and bulky phoneCamera quality is not good, it is same aschinese brand phoneFingerprint reader does not works if you are outside and your hands are little bit dirtyBattery life is equal to 5000 mah of Motorola phone.",

This is a damn good phone, don't overthink it just get it.When i was buying this phone i was really confused which one to get -M31, Redmi note 9 pro, etc.  But i took the leap and got this one - and i'm really happy. Don't be too critical if you want a robust phone that gets the job done.I was blown away by the AMOLED screen and whenever i see some images on it i still can't believe how good the screen is. At night the blacks are ABSOLUTELY black - an image with black background will look like it's floating if you're in a pitch dark room - point being the contrast is amazing.Camera is great, could be better - but that could be said for literally every phone. On this budget itna hi milega.Battery life is GREAT. I use it mildly for whatsapp, instagram, casual games, google apps, camera etc. and i honestly forget to charge my phone in 2 days, and i charge it on 3rd day morning.I recommend getting 6gb ram 128gb storage version.Just get it - don't think too much, don't waste time comparing, just get it.Highly recommend.",

I find camera of Poco F1 was great when compared. Overall gives a decent performance. Don't pick if you are buying phone just because of camera.Battery: Battery performance is excellent. Initially It struggled to last even one day but then I removed a lot of pre-installed apps and the performance increased. It would last for a day for a heavy user (not gamings all the time Ofcourse, but social apps).Ram/Performance:I do have plenty of apps, yet it works smooth.This phone comes up with a lot of preloaded apps, you may remove some but won't be able uninstall all apps (e.g. Netflix).Overall it's a decent deal at the price coming from Samsung.",

        "body": "I'm in love with this phone. I think its the best in its segment i.e. the below 15k mark. The sAmoled display is just superb and is worth the money. The super large battery is good but the charger is slow (a little). Tge camera quality is mind-blowing and captures crisp and clear photos. The front camera is super good too. The processor is just a little less powerful than of its competitors, good for low to moderate gaming. It does a fabulous job in day-to-day tasks and will not lag. Highly recommended. And one more thing you might get confused in between realme 6i and m21. I too got confused but if you are a gamer and don't care for your privacy go for realme 6i. But if you are a normal user who wants to surf net, get crisp quality photos, get a wonderful sAmoled display. Go for M21 without any hesitation. Best in its segment.",

Most worst thing is charging it's taking around 3hous to full charge... Background application and battery usage is most dissatisfaction of this mobile... Not suitable for long drive ones... Discharging is very fast and SAMSUNG needs to look into this to resolve... Once upon a time it's trending brand now slowly it's also becoming like NOKIA.. style one... Better to focus on performance and charging items on this brand... Any model same processors and if it mentions 6000mAh also it's not perform like 3500amh Galaxy Grand mobile... There are no changes from Galaxy Grand to Galaxy M21, 51.... Come out from bad look forward new technology updates to stand up in the market orelse it will become another NOKIA... keep on eye to grow up....!!!",

Being a stock android user (Nokia 8.1), One UI experience is aweful. Also, don't understand the point of using different UIs for different price segments. Samsung really needs to reconsider this business model.2. Apps are unstable - some of the apps keep resetting every now and then.3. Battery: even though it has 6000 mah battery, backup is still restricted to 1 full day, with heavy usage and adaptive battery enabled - this kind of battery backup is provided by any other handset. Then what's the difference in having a \"6000\" mah battery.4. Camera: shutter speed is unbelievably slow. You've hold the phone for significantly longer duration to get a good picture. Means instant clicks or sporty modes will not work.5. Performance: is Awful. With 10nm proccessor, it just cannot handle multitasking. App launching time is high.6. Background apps - don't run properly, even if specific apps are configured to run in the background. It's keep stopping and restarting if you move to another app.While this phone may be recommended for the low-medium level users. But certainly won't recommend for heavy users, or even for not-so-heavy users.In the entire ‚Çπ10,000 - ‚Çπ20,000, Samsung launched various phones but with the same OLD and slow proccessor (exynos 9611), which means performance will remain the same.I basically bought this phone as a non-chinese brand. However, it looks like, with the anti-china sentiments growing, Samsung really needs a tough competition from the brands like Sony and LG. Otherwise, they'll keep producing these kind of cheap products with no competition in the market.",

The only problem might be one's individual is this phone is quite big and heavy and I've to use both hands if need to use it for long duration. Need to uninstall and put on sleep lots of bloatware applications might be useful for others. I can get it whatever I want it from playstore.

Giving 4 star out of 5 for this reason.Had to return the product only because of this issue.

Excellent display - The best I have used in the last few years.2. Good battery - Non gaming person will end his day easily with 20% charge still left.3. UI - Could have been more cleaner but bloatware can either be uninstalled or disabled.4. System - Has call recording and various customization features by default which my earlier phones lacked.5. Camera - Could rate it 3.5 out of 5. Takes good photos but lacks 60fps video recording.  So camera rating is not a pro not a con.Cons :1. Design - Plastic body, non premium look, slippery design, fingerprint magnet.2. Charging - Takes 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.3. Fingerprint - I feel the positioning of fingerprint sensor is not at the correct place.4. Sensor - It uses front camera as light sensor for auto brightness, hence drains lot of battery until adaptive brightness is turned off.",

Any fault, you are on your own.My phone is lying with Service Center for more than a month, and they insist I pay money for the repair.Samsung is selling brand names and cheating Indian customers.

This is the first time I am feeling sorry to shop from Amazon. 6000mAh battery doesn't last for single day with no gaming, no video streaming and very modest use.The battery drains because of heating. Once used navigation in my Car and had to switch it off after 30 minutes due to over heating....its a safety risk.Tomorrow, I will get replacement mobile and sell it to a shop on Rs2000 less. Will buy other mobile from that shop.I wouldn't recommend this product. I wanted to buy a non China phone but looks like Samsung trying to ride on anti China sentiments and make profits, compromising on quality and safety.Worst thing....Amazon now does not protect interests of its customers.

Superb Display3.Design: 3/5 It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. No glass body, but who cares after you put a back cover. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available5. OS&UI: 5/5 Android 10 with One UI.6.Finger print reader and face lock 5/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 4/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers, but for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated.8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone.9. Accessories : 2/5 No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches.Verdict: For this price Its the best choice for a non gamer.",

They opened the phone and told me it is a problem with the phone display. I asked them to replace. They said the display will not come under warranty. I am not sure when the complete phone is under warranty for 1 year,  they can not replace the display with in 30 to 40 days of buying a product. Afterwards i asked them to replace for money. They said they do not have display part and I have to wait for a month. Problem here is that they are unable to say when the part will come to service center. I know samsung is a very good brand but if anyone goes through this kind of situation it will embarrassing. Now my phone is useless lying on the table. Who can help me now?",

NO gaming, bare minimum video watching, I get maybe a day and a half... not more. And what's the point of a 48MP camera if it has trouble focussing? Does Samsung think I'd rather have a 48MP blur? One of the reasons I bought this was for the supposedly good camera, but that dream has been put to bed! So come to think of it, basically, there's no really good reason anyone should buy this.

There are no Widgets for simple tasks like locking the screen & taking Screen shots.Finally it is one's personal choice whether he goes with the Chinese phones with all the best features except the MOLED display, Or with the Korean phone with the exceptional display at this price point.",

        "body": "My previous device was Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. By the time I bought this, Realme 7 was launched on flash, which in anyone's first look would be the best favourite in 15k range of smartphones. I never wanted to buy a Chinese made UI phone, the same reason why I bought Max Pro M1 more than 2yrs ago. Not because of this fake nationalism media furore, but because I genuinely care about my privacy. I always appreciate true Android OS experience, with the freedom to control my apps and settings. Why I'm writing about these things? Let's see.1. Samsung Galaxy M21 comes with its One UI 2.0, which has been recently updated to 2.1 with some camera improvements. It offers exactly same freedom to control app's permissions, check individual battery usage, use themes and feels better than the cheaper looking MiUI and RealmeUI.2. It comes with Samsung Max VPN function and I'm quite content with it. It saves me a lot of resources to not invest in a VPN subscription. However, it's slow and makes the browsing experience sluggish - story of every VPN ever existed. Still it's okay from privacy p.o.v.Now coming to the device's performance and features, I do not think I need to write much about it after 6 months of this device launch. I will simply post a 1-10 rating for each perspective.Performance: 7 (Occasional hiccups)Display: 9 (You already know about this)Ergonomics: 9 (Don't believe those saying its design looks outdated)Memory: 8 (in terms of multitasking)OS/Software: 9Rear camera: 7Front camera: 8Video capture: 8Battery: 10 (You might have already seen this coming, Gives me 10-12h screen usage)Miscellaneous - Face unlock & Fingerprint sensor: 9, Audio output from speaker: 7, Bluetooth connectivity: 7, WiFi reception: 9, Call through earpiece: 8, Body material: 6 (for using such a slippery plastic back), Heat dissipation: 4 out of 10The major issue I had handling this phone was due to this getting heated on the upper side of display, most probably due to a bad conductor of heat at its back. I haven't played a single game and I've stopped playing games on a phone long ago, so it's just the many shopping, social media apps and browsers that I multitask between. I ordered a flip cover along with the phone since AMOLEDs are thin glass, needs care while handling, but I couldn't use this phone with the flip more than a day! The upper part of display was heating up like a metal kept in sun. Such heating systems can permanently harm the motherboard and battery elements inside, along with your ears if you take calls at such times. I have also used my friend's Galaxy M20 and even that outdated device with 3GB RAM or so and a bad processor has better heat management.It gets mildly heated while keeping in the pocket, while charging, while multitasking a lot between social media and content downloading apps, every now and then even though I'm not a rough or heavy user. My screen usage a day stays within 6-9 hrs. I returned the flip and ordered a soft plastic back cover with a fabric design (You can get it at 149 from Amazon, it has holes on the back for air venting) but even that couldn't make it through more than 10 days of usage. Initially, it was handling heating fine but after a few days I again noticed similar heating issue. I returned it again and now I have ordered a plastic case, which simply holds it on edges and open on the buttons side and upper and bottom sides, hopefully for better ventilation. Doing fine since laat 2 days of use, but this doesn't provide any protection to display. It's just that I happen to be very cautious while handling my gadgets so I know it will survive for years in my hands. I never encountered such heating issues in my Asus Max Pro M1 with a metal back and rugged cover over it, even during heavy gaming and multitasking. It was there but on very rare occasions though. I have seen Samsung India responding to reviews here so, take a Note, Samsung.Verdict: I'm posting this on 2nd Oct, and I think still looking at the competition of the kind of products in this range, M21 is a good buy. If you can manage with the heating issue, which if you use with a partially-open back cover (the one in pic) or without any cover at all, won't be there. I wanted a phone I don't need to run for a charger every now & then, it checks that point quite well.Leave a Like to this review if you think this helped you choose a better option. Cheers.",

The glass was in pristine condition and there was absolutely no damage to the phone but it had developed this issue on its own. I took it to Samsung's official service center and they denied warranty over a manufacturing defect. I had to pay 5 and a half grand out of my own pocket for the repair.Would definitely **not** recommended anyone to buy this.",

Samsung though may offer a bit less on the processor side but the hardware material and basically the only thing that matters the most to me is the Screen Quality. Really soothing to eyes as compared to these other mobiles. And talking about this phone, its battery,camera,screen quality, even processor are really good.

Also, the body build quality is very bad and cheap. Samsung mentioned that it has L1 support for the HD video content but whenever watching hd quality video even on the youtube, it degrade video quality form high to low resolution. And at the end, with such bad impression while holding and operating this phone, feel that the price of this is much high. It should be around 8k to 9k only for the quality they are selling. Go for the Nokia phones, they are far better than all these kind of phones.",

I am not gamer but it fulfills all my daily tasks without any lag.Display : It is just beautiful and looks extra ordinarycharging : charging takes around 3 hours to get fully charged but that is ok for 6000 maH battery and in the current budget. one can keep adding the budget if he is keen to increase the features.Samsung UI : Samsung comes with some bloatwares which can either be uninstalled or disabled but the UI is good and contains lot of additional features.Sound : Atmos is supported through headphones which gives pleasant experience and speakers are loud enough. Can be slow for the Chinese phone users.Final Verdict : For a normal user who wants a beautiful display , powerful battery and a non Chinese phones to avoid the spyware on your activities then this phone is great phone in budget.",

        "body": "After going through so many phones, I finally decided to buy this one. I checked the phone for few days, here are my observations -1. Battery Backup - 4/5, no complain for backup2. Fast Charging - 3/5, It took 2.5 hr to go from 5% to 100%3. Camera - 3.5/5, Front Camera is good, On Rear Side it has only, Wide Angle & Ultra Wide Angle but no Telephoto Lens. Zoom only works for Wide Angle lens but it is useless as it is not Lens zoom rather it is software zoom, it means capturing a shot then zoom out to check a spot is same as capturing the zoomed out shot, at least I felt this way. There are few other features in camere like -  in built editor for Slowmo Videos, Panorma, GIF creator.4. Speakers - 3/5, It is avg not very great, although I loved the Dolby Atmos feature, it enhances the 3D Audio experience to next level. Mic & receivers were all working properly in initial few calls, not sure about their future. I have seen many complain about Mic, Receiver after 5-6 month of use.5. Finger Print - 4/5, It is fast, was able to distinguish different fingers even with same patterns.6. Face Unlock - 4/5, It is also fast, had feature to enable/Disable fast unlock but I did not feel any difference when enabled/Disabled. It has option to stop unlock when eyes are close, so no one can unlock while you are sleeping :). only complain is, was not able to detect Glasses, was unlocking with/without Glasses, don't know if this is the feature.7. Display - 4/5, I did not feel much difference between LCD & LED display but I have to believe on experts if they are saying LED Panel have more colors blah...Let it be. Problem is with non-standard resolution, sometimes even 1080p video files are not covering the whole screen, although inbuilt video player has the option to stretch to fit the screen. Faced same problem with youtube videos but sadly there was no option to stretch there. Due to curved screen corner options are also not completely visible with Games.8. I was excited to know whether this phone supports the simultaneous call & internet access on different sim Cards but sadly it does not. You won't be able to use Data with SIM2 if are on call with SIM1. Although both SIM slots 4G LTE.9. Speed & Graphics - 3.5/5, to check speed I installed few Games, I installed Call of Duty 2.0+GB game & NFS no limits around 1.0GB. I did not face any lag with NFS but with Call of Duty faced Lag sometime.10. Initial Memory Usage was 15.0 GB. Phone had many unwanted apps, I was able to uninstall many of them but could not remove the NetFlix & facebook app, only option was to disable them.Although I tried playing games but I feel it is not a gaming phone, Except sAMOLED display, Dolby Atmos I don't see any flagship features in phone.Please be careful while setting up phones otherwise will receive lot of marketing notifications from Samsung. Mistakenly I clicked some options with reading enough & then Samsung Galaxy Store started downloading lot of unnecessary apps, there was no way so stop it, I could get the Download queue, it really made me Sad that a brand like Samsung also do such things. I was manually stopping the apps as soon they start downloading, I spent 30 mins doing this.",

The UI given here gives lot of freedom to edit yourself like a superuser. The hardware and the software perfectly optimise as every things hands on samsung. Battery life as it mentioned Monster. I here about network issue which I faced also in my jio sim but if you perfectly in network setting then you can see the network mode is by default set in LTE/3G/2G (auto connected) which is the problem if you don't change to LTE only, because jio has only 4G network support and it doesn't have any 3G and 2G network, when the device fell that the LTE signal is become weaker then it automatically changes the network to lower suitable one, so I suggest the user who have this type of issue and using 4G sim then change the setting to LTE only. You'll get a great superb camera.I did't like the built quality where the company did price cutting for giving a AMOLED display which gets easily scratch by your surrounding recommendation to use case and temper glass as immediately you buy the product. Charging speed is too slower as compare to huge battery which is ok. Only i missing here is network speed indicator which can be resolve by a third party app but every company giving this one but samsung..?? hope they will update that one in next update .Finally best in this budget but company should provide case with the mobile.",

I have never used Samsung Smart Phones before and purchased this one after using Mi and Honor Devices. I don't know about the part quality but in case of UI both the cheesiness brands are way ahead of this one. I am listing some pros and cons of this phone below:Pros:1. Super Display Quality2. Brand Image of SamsungCons:1. No Finger Swipe Screen Shot. (Which was a great feature of both Mi and Honor Phones)2. No Selfie on touching finger print scanner. You have to press the volume down key to take a selfie.3. Camera Too Slow. It is taking nearly 30 seconds to save a photo though it has a UFS 2.0 Memory card5. Wifi 2.4G connecting on 72mbps speed which will give at most 30 mbps internet speed while other phones are connecting at 150 or 135 mbps speed.6. Finger Print scanner is too small and hard to find.7. It has a problem with Whatsapp. Whenever I use Whatsapp Web phones notification sounds continuously.8. Network speed can't be displayed in notification area.9. Full of bloatware which will get downloaded automatically when the phone first started up.10. Security features like cleaning and call blocking is hard to find.",

But truly I say to all of you water issue is impossible as this phone was used only in my room. And same issue I have noticed with near about 5 other person who came to repair their mobile within warranty. And they ask me 6500/- to repair it. Think visit any service center then you may proceed for buy at your own risk.",

        "body": "I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant. The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer.",

The soft plastic which acts like a cushion between the phones plastoc back and the screen has a very poor fit(See attached image). I ordered a replacement within few minutes after unboxing. The replacement unit has proper fittin but it still doesn't look good enough.Whoever bought this phone already check your phone. and the ones who are going to buy make sure you check each and every corner this phone.Most of the phones in the market provide a pre-applied scratch guard on the screen and a silicone case. This phone literally provides none of them. The phone does provide a good chipset, memory, screen, battery, camera etc.  Thumbs up to Samsung for this. But all these wont matter if the back plastic and the screen has visible gaps.CHECK YOUR M21 AFTER YOU PURCHASE IT.",

And not a good looking phone if you are looking for premium looks.",

I am home locked inside due to lockdown and we don't venture out at all. Have been using it sparingly and all of a sudden the display started becoming purple. I tried to claim under warranty but they denied saying it is damaged due to mishandling. I asked the customer care to show me a scratch. They simply wasted my time for 8 days and finally said they can't help. The customer service is indeed pathetic. I will edit this review again with all the photos, recorded discussions with customer care and etc. Please never buy this. My Redmi Note 5, purchased in July 2018 is still going strong. I purchased this one only for better SAR levels but it's been a very short nasty ride with Samsung. I usually don't trust South Korean and Chinese products, I always go for Indian, Japanese, Europe or American even if they are manufactured in China. This experience reassured me that I should never opt for South Korean products.",

Battery life is quite good but it doesn't come with any fast charger which makes it to take 2hours to charge completely. Call connectivity is decent. The camera is good in daylight and pretty avg during night time. It seems a bit bulky in hand to carry because of a 6000mah battery. RAM management was good. I never played any games but I think it can handle basic games without any issue but have to think if you play heavy games. As the Exynos processor is not designed for the gaming you need to pick either snapdragon or Helio processor for Gaming. It also seems to slightly overpriced when compared to other devices with additional features. Still, Samsung delivers the different experience.",

I spent 14000/ now again it requires 5500/ for repair just after one month of purchase.  There were many other clients were complaining the same problem at the service center. Pl don't buy it.",

The scree is very sensitive to be broken.2. very lagging interface3. very slow processor.4. took time to call and hang up the calls.5. no back cover provided by samsung.6. even you will face little bit of lag sometime in candy crush.7. you can play pubg but you have to play in very poor graphics setting.8. the most annoying feature is you will get notifications tone all the time but when you open notification bar nothing will appear ..also whatsapp notification have no light alert mode i.e. only sound alert is available..overall if you want to waste money you can definitely go for this..redmi 9pro is best option instead of this...",

It has the feature of hyper-lapse as long as u want at x4, x8, x16, x32, and 6000 mAh battery favors long-lasting hyper time-lapse.**BATTERY** - Best battery backup mobile in the present time(2020) at this price tag.  At 20 % battery, you can chill out 2 hours listening to songs, normal youtube video at 720p, and many more. It has 15 watts charging which feels pretty less for a 6000 mAh battery. Takes almost 2 hours and 20 mins to charge ideally, although after charging it's ready for 2 days normal using (video recording for 1 hour, capturing tons of images, 2-hour music, and calling, 5 hours video watch time, and many more.

No earphones provided in the box - I think Samsung should consider that. Camera is good - colours are captured well. Not a professional one but its too much if you are expecting a hi-funda camera at this price.Overall - value for money.",

So it's a give and take. However one can not compete with those who are known tech. thieves.Comes with lot of uninstallable bloatware(Facebook/Netflix/MS cloud to name a few).A daily data counter (usages info.) in notification drawer and a icon to lock screen display is a necessary inclusion Samsung must think about.Processor is good contrary to general belief. Can handle some pretty heavy apps which SD 636 (RN5P) couldn't handle with same memory config.( PS:I am not a Gamer).Overall impressed. My next phone will also be a Samsung when my other phone(RN8P) completes its threshold.Will update my review once return period is over/ after a month's use)And Samsung please care to add a cheap plastic cover and screen protector. Will be life saver till one buys a good one.",

I use high brightness and in this at 40% only I am happy.3. It is good in speed comparing to the price range.Cons:1. Heating problem from start. Even on normal use. Felt this after so many years.2. Battery does not comprehend with its specs. It looks like 4000+ mah one.3. On the top the battery takes a mammoth of time to get charged. So gaming people might feel uncomfortable.4. Build quality is not good. Sometimes some small addition can make wonders with out extra cost. Back is finger and scratch caller.Overall it is a good product in the price range. I didnt gave any camera review as I am not a professional and the comparison is with my other mobiles which are way above in price and quality.",

While other phones connect with 150mbps link speed to my  wifi router this phone connects to 2.4Ghz band at max 72mbps and 5Ghz band at around 400mbps. While tested on 2.4Ghz band, the network speed drops compared to my Huawei devices. On 60mbps connection I am getting 30mbps max while on the Huawei device I am getting 56mbps max. Although call quality is good, network signal strength drops to -80dBm compared to Huawei Honor 6x device @ -60dbm. 4G speed on LTE is also below the Huawei device. Getting 4mbps downlink on this device compared to 15mbps downlink on the huawei device. Wifi signal also drops very often and refuses to connect to the router. Then I have to turn the wifi off and on to be able to connect back. This makes this phone unusable.",

You have to clear cache files in Google Play Store and Play Services App to get rid of this problem time to time. You will never face this problem in MI or Vivo mobiles as these cache got automatically deleted after download.4.Build quality is very bad(plastic).5.Samsung unnecessarily hiked the price of all mobiles.6.UI of Samsung mobile is not all user friendly like MI.7.It is true that only display, battery and camera are good and rest is faltu.",

Display is Good. The media sound volume is very low, there is only one speak below right side...so you might block sound while holding phone in your hand. Earphone or Headphones is preferred for media Sound. Finger printreader is a little bit slow...it takes atleast 1.5-2 seconds for unlock in my case.I bought this for Rs.14000, just because I don't want to buy a Chinese phone. I go for Samsung this time... but a little bit of disappointment from Samsung.",

This was done after the company packaging and before the dealer put their tag.Although have no complaints with the product, but yeah the virtual light sensor that uses camera is totally awful and doesn't works properly, Samsung should focus on it and give a proper light sensor or improve the virtual sensor's performance by software updates.",

Make sure that you select what you need.Pros1.Country of Origin-For buyers who look for Made in India phones,definitely you could get this.2.Battery suits for very normal users.3.security Mcafee comes with this. we need to turn on for security.4.Processor is ok.5.Super AMOLED display6.No heating issues.7.Android 10 with UICons1.Mono speaker.2.Camera light output is low. Camera wasn't appreciating. For this price camera design should have been better.3.Lot of preinstalled apps,which I don't like.4.Takes quite long time to charge. Even fast charging mode switched. This was unexpected.5.No headphones or screen guard provided. We need to buy separately.6.Dolby gets switched only when you use headset,bluetooth headset mode.ConclusionGood phone for normal users.
