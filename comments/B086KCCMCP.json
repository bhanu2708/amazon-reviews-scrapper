I have contacted customer care they requested replacement for this phone but it was rejected by Amazon pick up agent. The agent said he needs IMEI number to confirm then only he can pickup this phone. I have contacted several times Amazon customer services, they arrange pickup but pickup agent reject it saying I can’t pickup this phone without IMEI number. How can anyone check the IMEI number if the phone is having software issue. It’s been 20 days now I am without phone because I have purchased this in exchange option.",

I have used samsung phones previously so I am familiar with the samsung UI and trust the durability of the phone.  The phone is good and I have not experienced any problem with lagging or the display. The phone is handy and fits well in the hand but a little heavy for its size. The screen brightness and clarity are quite good. One problem I faced is with the sensitivity of the touch screen, it is slow and not as smooth as some other phones in a similar price range.The camera is average. It takes time to focus sometimes and its not good in low light at all.The battery workes for about 1 or 1.5 days with average use (4-5 hours of video playtime along with other apps running in the background).One clear con is the lack of fingerprint reader. It is available in most phones. The sound quality of the speaker is good and clear.Overall, I would suggest buying this phone for basic feature requirement if you do not use your phone camera for photography.",

Loudspeaker is not loud enough.No headphones, backcover, screen guard included, charging cable is very short.Ordered this after getting frustrated with MI flash sale scam. Okayish mobile for around 8k. Would suggest to spend around 2k more and get a better mobile.",

I confirm that this is not even 0.5 MP. The JIO keypad phone has a better camera. If the rear is of this quality imagine the front???2. After nearly 1 months use the battery seems to last for not more than 10 hours for calling and not more than 5-6 hours if online.3. The weight along with the added coverings is about 180 grams.4. Display is ok but not great.PROS1. The processor is d quad, it's great for browsing, video, YouTube, movies and all other related things.2. The memory is 32 gb the system and other apps take away more than 15gb. The remaining is for you to use.3. RAM is 3GB seems very good for gaming in small apps.",

Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.",

        "body": "I have been using Samsung for last 4 years and I shall give you an honest feedback or review on SAMSUNG GALAXY M01. The phone is just awesome in this price. I have bought it at a price of 8300 INR from Amazon. The delivery is par excellance as usual. 3 GB. RAM and 32 GB internal storage with 15 MP camera made this a brilliant phone ever produced by Samsung.The phone is very, very little or no hang issue. You can use it for all purpose day to day need. Sound quality is good and about the battery life? It takes not more than 3 hours to get it charged fully. If you are charging from your power bank then it will take not more than 2 and half hours.I listen to audio video song and there is no buffering issue as such. The phone is nice because it has built with 4000mAh battery and infinity V display. It is available in black, blue and red color and the color of the phone is matty, yet glossy. The best thing is you can easily grab it in your hand. The camera quality is good. It has PLS TFT LCD display. The phone brightness automatically ups and down as per the necessity of light which is good I believe. The octa core CPU is enough for day to day use.I am simply enjoying it. I believe you will also love it.",

Doesn't hang in the typical samsung way.3. Android V10 out of the box.4. Airtel Wifi Calling supported, Networks are strong.5. Awesome battery backup  After keeping Hotspot tethering on full day, then also phone gives a lot of backup. One can watch two to three movies in one charge.6. Display is crisp, watching movies is good experience on it.7. Samsung default launcher works smoothly.8. Dual sim VOLTE support and separate memory card slot is provided. Internet speed is good in rural areas also.9. Overall good calling experience.10. Sound quality from earpiece and speaker, both are good.11. Voice recognition for OK GOOGLE and Alexa (in app only) both are good.12. NO INBUILT ADDS - after all it's a non Chinese phone.13. Inbuilt parallel space like space, so dual WhatsApp and telegram etc are easy to operate.14. Inbuilt CALLER ID -15. Dolby Atmos Supported16. Dark Mode, focus mode, wind down all are supported.17. Face recognition works smoothly.Cons1. Camera is not that much good, but auto focus works smoothly for QR code scanning.2. Battery charging is old school - micro USB and Long charging time dilutes the experience.3. Internal memory of 64 GB could have been better.4. No fingerprint reader.Overall Samsung gave a reliable and beautiful device.",

The design is nice and compact and fits perfectlyin one hand. (Some might say that this isn’t agood thing but personally I prefer smaller, compact phones).2. It has a good display.3. The phone comes with a Snapdragon processor.(Even though the version is not an advanced one,yet it’s better than Exynos).4. Long lasting battery backup. The battery lasts a  whole day without the need to charge.5. Call quality is clear. (Not something to mention in the pros section as this is THE main purpose of any mobile phone but still).6. The build looks to be strong as I dropped it multiple of times by mistake but there were no visible scratches.7. Comes with Android 10 and is really smooth.8. One UI is really comfortable and easy to use.Cons :1. Poor camera quality. The photos are not clear. You will need to hold the phone really steady and yet the pictures won’t be of good quality.2. Lack of fingerprint scanner.3. Speaker not that great. Sounds are not at all clear.4. Lack of phone accessories in the box such as a tempered glass and plastic back cover should be a must yet aren’t provided.5. The charging cable is not long enough also it charges slowly.6. The 3gb RAM might pose some problems in the future.All is all to sum it up. This is a go to phone for one’s who use the phone only for official purpose but if you’re looking for a phone for gaming, not at all. The phone is Samsung so obviously it lives upto  the brand name. If you are person who likes to take a lot pictures then I would recommend against this.",

Don’t buy thisCamera- 3/5 camera is disappointing both front and back. Also the front camera is slow as well.Face lock- 3/5 average one , it don’t work in low light.Display- 4/5 not a great display though it’s adjustable.Battery- 4.5/5 it has good battery backup 4000mah but another problem is that it takes lots of time to charge the mobile.Speaker-4/5 it is good , provides enough sound.Altogether-4/5This mobile fits in hand properly. So far I had not experienced any heating problems. It has good battery backup, it’s very helpful. If you prefer a budget mobile which is MADE IN INDIA, go for it.Major attraction:1: Android 10.2: Samsung ONE UI 2.0.3: A snapdragon processor instead of Exynos.4: Good battery backup.5: light weight.6: MADE IN INDIA.Major cons:1: Poor camera quality.(specially front camera)2: Just 5 watts and 1 A charger, it takes lots of time to charge it.(3-4 hours) Must have given at least a 10 watts charger.3: No screen guard, back cover and ear phones with this pack.4: It is overpriced, should have been priced 8k or below with this limited features.5: Comes with a snapdragon 439. Samsung must have given a better processor in this price.",

        "body": "This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.",

The phone is a heavy weight one, compared to other phones of the same segment. Thickness of the phone is just too much! 3. Display is narrow ( it may be preferred by people who like a little smaller phone). 4. Touch screen doesn't have a standard response effect, not that smooth.",

I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.",

I was thinking about purchasing other brands in this range.. but Samsung's brand name is better if you want are looking for reliability I guess. If you are looking for a good phone at this price this is a steal. Go for it, you wont regret.",

My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.",

Good for those who like small handy phones.6. No heating issue.7. Descent camera. Cant expect much in this price rangeCons1. Battery charging speed . Took approx. 3 hours to fully charge from 0 to 100 percent as no C type chargering slot available for this phone.2. No fingure print sensor but can be manageble.3. Phone thickness is 9.8 mm and after cover its thickness is around 11 mm so it could be more slim.OverallYou can't expect more in this price range with non chinese brand.Good phone for normal users who generally use it for calling and social networking and like small handy phones.Not recommended for gaming use (though I did not try gaming on this phone)",

Because also have mother HD+ phone which is more clear than this m01.Performance is also not upto the mark.All disadvantages in it.But there is Only one advantage if you also antichina then you get 'Samsung' only 'name' from non Chinese brand.That's only advantage 😂Buy if you want to let samsung use anti china sentiment and let samsung earn more money via overpriced.",

        "body": "Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.",

The following are the things why I like and dislike about  the product:-Pros:1.Battery Life- with 4000mah battery the the battery is powerful for day long intensive use.2. Display-with 5.7 infinity display, the screen the best you can get at this price range.3.Processor- with snapdragon octa core processor the phone is perfect for multi window functions and moderate gaming.4.Android: comes with the latest version of Android 10.5.Memory - comes with 3 gb ram and and 32 gb internal memory with sd card support upto 512 gb which is really good.6. The dark comes looks really cool to me.7. Shape is really nice as it sticks to your palm giving you comfort and I-phone kind of a feeling.Cons:Camera- I must say Samsung fails in a certain way when it comes to camera .Chinese brands are way ahead in this criteria. This is the only thing where Samsung misses out.Overall I give a double thumbs up to this device apart from camera.This is THE PRODUCT product to buy in this  price range if you want to avoid non-chinese product.Also not forget the good after sales service you get from Samsung,they have service centres all over India.",

        "body": "DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like \"IAF:A cut above\" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.",

Battery life is good and no heating issue is there so far (although i don't think  this phone is ideal for hard gaming ) and the sound quality is really impressive. The only complain i have is that camera quality just does not seem to be 13mp and 2mp , i am not an expert but my previous device was from lenovo which also had dual camera of 13mp and 2mp focus but the picture quality was far better than this device.Overall, at this cheap price this phone is really a good buy.",

Just a bit disappointed with camera quality. Somehow I felt that this product is bit overpriced. Samsung could have packed a headphone or backcover with this product. If you want to gift this phone to your parents or children I would suggest you must buy it. Moreover you can trust the samsung apllications. Hope this review helps :) Happy shopping with Amazon delivery was really fast. The pricing policy was also very strategic.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Samsung.",

Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???",

I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.",

So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.",

Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..",

Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive.I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues. All the features are reliable and easy to use.Talking about battery, since I do not use social media and gaming, battery for me lasts for about 2 days after one full charge.You can also hide the navigation keys from the screen and still navigation will be seamless.Another best feature is that you can disable the pre installed Google apps on this phone if you are too concerned about Google collecting your personal data.I haven't used the camera much, so I cannot give review for the camera, but bear in mind that it comes with depth effect.Just one improvement the manufacturers could have maintained is not placing the speakers on the rear panel. The sound doesn't plays clearly when phone is placed on soft surfaces like bed. Some users might not like it.Overall, I find this phone excellent for myself. So, I give it 5 stars.",

Battery backup lasts for a day with heavy social media use and light gaming.  Even played COD mobile and PUBG on low settings and the game play was fine.  Charging takes around 4 hours with the in box 5w charger, but can be charged with a 10W charger. Overall a good product where my privacy isn't jeopardized.",

Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!",

Stunning Design (Red colour looks damn sexy)4. Value for Money5. Thin Body great benefit for the one's like me who use the smartphone with one hand.Cons:1. Camera seems a bit average due to over bright and filtered pictures. I loved the old cameras by Samsung which had touch of originality. Capturing even the wrinkes and imperfections on your face.

        "body": "I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define \"Normal\". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)",

Provides very good practical battey back-up and a good form factor.Update: samsung seems to be collecting unwanted user details. I bought this phone for my dad. Got sms in his number used on phone to review this phone in Amazon. They collected the phone number used in phone. Send the information to samsung server. Also they some how know the phone is bough from Amazon. Unethical collection of information without consent.",

Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.",

Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000",
