This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.",

Since it's for my mom I didn't even bother testing it outdoors.For the price I paid the pros outweigh the cons.Ads, bloatware, camera and the fact that it's Chinese are the only cons I can think of after a week's usage.",

(using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).‚óèDon't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.‚óèThe battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).‚óèThe front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.‚óèThe screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.‚óèFace unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.‚óèNow the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.",

You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.",

Besides why did they had to come out with shady hue (Sky White, Midnight Grey & Sea Blue) versions, & why not just simple sleek 'Black or White' . They could have been more simple though, i don't seem if the design at the rear does any wonders or is  wow factor..Thanks to Amazon!",

I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I‚Äôve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it‚Äôs the worst performance phone. I‚Äôm not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I‚Äôm talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is ‚ÄúTHE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST‚Äù. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I‚Äôd rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I‚Äôd not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.",

        "body": "I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is \"just okay\".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.",

But people also perform an exchange if the old product is having a small defect. Physical shops are far better in this case. Irrespective of what's wrong with the old product even a complete dead phone are exchanged and a flat amount of 500 to 1000 is deducted from original cost of the new phone. I had a working phone with no problem. The delivery boy examined the phone that was ready for exchange  and found to horizontal lines on the phone which was not blocking the display. Touch was working well yet for all he rejected exchange just because of two lines on the Display stating that the display is damaged. This should have been stated correctly in terms and condition of exchange. Amazon is not for defective exchange. Really first time bad experience. My take goodbye Amazon Prime. No more monthly subscription. Thank you",

Not even able to read atleast a word properly.Some times it seems normal but most of the time they are not working. I have brought this for my siblings for attending online classes. But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me. I have discussed this with an advocate.",

I would like to highlight the MIUI in this phone, it is GREAT. I never expected MIUI to be so excellent... it is better than Samsung in some ways.Conclusion:It is a great phone, but remember that the camera is not great and the battery life is not as expected.",

Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2¬Ω days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.",

I replaced this device with another withing 10days you know we got time right?After 6 months i got display issue with white dot on it because of overheating im normal user and casual gamer still i got that issue the device is still not capable of day to day tasks and casual gaming and all.So after i went for service center to fix my device it got stuck till Month around. They provide cheap services too. After 20 30 calls i got my device with just display replace not evem single try on heating problem.I request for New device because of this poor service and all and still my mobile is not fully repair though i gotta mailed from xiaomi that with term and condition we cannot get you a New devide and submit your phone at service center for pending issue.This is how they treat customer and this poor brand just solving issue till your mobile is fully repaired and get stuck again after sometimes.Very poor service, very poor brand, even their coordination with us is poor too.I recommend to dont buy this brand and don't brand this phone.Go for Samsung any other brand its gives much much better service than this.",

Type C charging port provided which is nice but a fast charger would've been nice. Colour options are subjective but I personally like the gloss finish and solid colours on the Redmi 8. The faded pattern makes this look not so nice but they tried to do something out of the ordinary. Thing is, this was a relatively cheap phone before the recent price hike and therefore, there is no fingerprint scanner and the phone doesn't look very premium from the back. But this is one of the most affordable phones with 3 GB ram currently and comes with a decent enough processor. Chinese yes, but then the other companies can't even come close to what Xiaomi offers at this price. There is no slow motion video recording and there are intrusive ads in the firmware which sucks. The ads can be turned off to an extent but it sucks.",

Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.",

The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.",

The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work .

The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.",

When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.

        "body": "I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.",

Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.",

You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.",

Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.",
