I had got a maximum backup of 3 day with single charge at normal usage.2. 64 mp camera is just fantastic. Pictures are crisp and detailed. Even it will not haze with sufficient zoom. Night mode is much better then other phones.3. Look is also good with a punch hole camera. Samsung has maintained a premium look even after housing a 6000 mah battery. Phone looks slim.4. Display is much better even then premium Chinese smartphone. Super amoled as it is.5. Finger print sensor is much faster. Face lock is also very good.6. Speakers are loud and crisp. U will get clear, loud and detailed sound while calling and music/ videos playing.7. Gastric look also provide a premium look. (Even Glass back is desired as it becomes a standard now a days).8. Phone weight less with 6000 mah battery. It takes 1.5 hrs to completely charge. Thanks to 25 watts super fast charging from samsung.",

All of these phones look very similar, have nearly identical specifications with a few bits swapped around, and have all been released in the span of a year.HIGHLIGHTSThe Samsung Galaxy M31s starts at Rs. 19,499 in India.The Infinity-O display is a first on a Galaxy M series smartphone.The Galaxy M31s is capable of reverse charging with its 6,000mAh battery.The monster battery might be really good for a long night of movie binging. The screen is also superb. The sound quality is not bad either.The only drawnach here is that with only 22.5 watt charging it takes around 1 hour 45 mins to charge.Otherwise the phone is superb.

Without even asking or showing any notification it does so silently wothout any intimation. Absolute crap to choose samsung as a buy today. Amazon does not take returns after the days are over of return window but that is brand ne 20L phone stops charging and becomes useless within first month of use. terribly disappointed in samsung as well as amazon. Don't buy this crap at all. bad decision I must say when i thought to buy this. And now keeping a brick next to my pillow which looks good but does not work as phone.",

So after the call , I tried to switch off the phone, But no response other than vibrations. Then I received another call, since screen got blackout , Couldn't pick up the call. Tried to reboot the phone, nothing happened. I waited overnight. Next day morning , I tried again to do something. But nothing was happening. Thenafter by evening I took the phone to service center , They told the software trashed. They repaired and gave back in another 3 hrs.But I really can't believe that it's a 8 GB RAM and still getting hanged a lot. Soo depressed .Really don't know Is this a 8 GB processor itself.

I prefer this camera than the other chinese phones which will make you look extreme pretty even though you're not. Those phones do so much editing that I don't like.Final say is that I am very happy with the performance and I get peace knowing it that I am not using a Chinese phone. I charge it one time only for a day.",

        "body": "I have my little story about M31S & Amazon to share! I bought M31S in August 2020 then after 9 days I had to replace it coz it suddenly stopped charging!  I got the replacement from amazon. From the date I received after 14 days same issue again. Not getting charged! Phone was able to charge with other charger and the charger was able to charge other phone. After getting same defect again I asked amazon to either give me replacement or take this product back! I talked with almost 4 Customer Executive including Senior one and even sent them e-mails! They were literally slamming back to back same statement \"its out of return period and we can't take it back. That's our Policy\" . So they asked me to bring \"Service Denial Letter\" from Samsung Service Center and after that they will initiate my request. When I reached out to service center they said that they don't provide such kind of letter. Once the phone reach to their service center they just repair it anyhow. Samsung also have other policy which is literally of no use if you are purchasing online that If I would have come between first 14 days after purchase then they would have gave me replacement. I mean WTF! !So technically 14 days will start from the date of ORDER PLACED so, its of no use! Then I just gave it for repairing. I had no choice. I was lost. I invested 19500 rupee to get a defective product! Its not a small amount! I was literally getting killed by stress! It was my second time having similar experience and yet they were not helping me. Last time it was with ZUK Z2 plus. It literally had manufacturing defect of ghost touch. Ghost touch is while charging you get multiple touch response for one single touch. I mean seriously put bots instead of humans for Customer support. In the end both are doing same work! HARASSING AND BULLYING!!",

As soon as i read M31s had a primary 64MP sony IMX682 sensor, knew my search was over.Pros:1. Camera quality exceptional, very impressed with low light and night shots.2. 6000mah battery lasts almost 2 days with decent usage. Dont need to fret about plugging in every night.3. Clean UI, very limited bloatware4. 1 year complete protection at very nominal priceCons:1. Side fingerprint sensor is too narrow for my male fingers. Could never open lock in one attempt. Very frustrating. Samsung should have gone with traditional finger print sensor placements at back or front. I guess on screen sensor is too much to ask at this price.2. Screen freeze, after unlocking screen if you were browsing or reading, have frequently observed scroll to freeze. Unless i press return or minimize window, scroll dosent start to work. Very surprised to see such major software glitch, hope samsung solves this in future software updates.All in all its a good package. I could over come the cons as for me pros out weight cons.  M31s launch had perfect timing for me as i was looking for a under 20k phone with decent battery, scpecs and an awesome camera. Non-chinese brand was a cherry on top.",

Only reason I bought this phone was because I did not want to buy a Chinese Phone.The performance of this phone is worse than a Chinese Phone.Only good thing is it's screen size and display.The phone isn't very fast to respond. It hangs frequently. Everytime I unlock this phone the application which is already open does not work.I have to close the app and open it again.The fingerprint sensor on the side button also requires getting used to. It locks often as we hold the phone in our hand as it starts recognising anything on the sensor as our fingerprints which fail to match.If you don't save all the WhatsApp images to your gallery by default, there is no option to save it manually. Such a pain.Google Chrome also won't update no matter what.",

It is not at all a micro lens. It gives the same results as close shot by any other lens.2. The 5000mAH battery of  M30 was better than 6000 mAH battery of M31s. I was getting M30 backup till night 9 - 9.30 pm and now I can get backup till 7 pm with same usage.3. The ram again is not make much difference. I doubt Samsung really has using the given configuration and improved the design.Finally, it was my WRONG decision to go for M31s. It is useless.",

Though I don't play games.Camera: I am in love with it.Though,The macro camera is of no use.The single take feature is of no use for meBut the HDR and AI are well optimised in this device.Vid quality is decent.Has electronic image stabilization.Display: I would have given 10 stars out of 5 if it was possible. Brilliant display with great quality! Even in direct sunlight.Supports always on display.The hole punch is quite small. And after few days it's nearly unnoticeable.Battery: if you are buying it because of 6000 mah battery, you might not be pleased.I am just getting a day out of it!Charging: just after 3 months it's taking 2.5 hrs (approx) to charge fully.I am disappointed with the charger.22 W charger is just a mental peace thing!Design: looks beautiful in hand. But a fingerprint magnet. And please use case. My one got a scratch from my finger ring.Touch screen: works even with wet fingers.Fingerprint: wet hands will not work.Even with light sweat, the fingerprint stops working.UI: I felt the UI is lot better than redmi and realmi.Add free and smooth experience.Special: it has a grip sensor which detects how you are holding the phone and adjusts it's antennas according to get the best signal.If you have this device you can check your grip sensor.Dial *#0*# and then select grip sensor.It's amazing!Conclusion:If you want brilliant camera and the best display in this price range, go for it.You will love it.But if you just want battery, I will suggest not to go with this device.",

HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.",

Screen sharpness ..too good even in sunlight , it rather gets accentuated and  pictures by default  looks brighter and sharper. Perfect clear loud sound quality distinctly clearer than Samsung M 30S . 6000mAH battery charging phone from zero to 100 % level in around 110-120 mins and then forget for two days ... run you tube, WhatsApp, Outlook, Gmail, PowerPoint ,Excel or Telly erp 9.0 or whatever .. it handles them with utter  ease .The camera quality and Bluetooth connectivity from  earbuds to stand-alone Speakers  is excellent. Video graphy quality is pretty good coour of objects photographed or video graphed is quite close to original one! All four cameras are doing great job.The size in holding in hand and working single handedly  is with ease . DOES NOT WAARM up either on charging or while playing You Tube content for a longer period. it gives run for money to more expensive Chinese sets . Greates assurance is the prompt after sales if required ven for any big or small issue ,if it all happens. I bought on-line from Amazon ... Perfect  Packaging  with charger , charger wire, manual were in the box, The moment I switched on after charging for 45 mins put in all my credentials, it became ALIVE MUCH to my satisfation and using Samsung Smart Switch , the data from old Samsung Phone Galaxy J7 Prime 3GB RAM & 16GB INTERNAL STORAGE plus Samsung Evo Class 10 64 GB Micro SD card  was transferred to the new phone Samsung Galaxy M31S with 8GB RAM & 128 GB INTERNAL STORAGE with Samsung EVO Plus  128 GB microSDXC card  in around 45 mins to 60 mins max.i booked it on Aug 10,2020 and received on Aug 16,2020.That point in time to date I have been using without any complaint for slow functioning or heating issues even when  30 apps are concurrently running.this phone loves to be used extensively . since purchase, I have received two updates as well which has further improvised the UI of the phone towards better.My personal rating  for this phone  Model # SM-M317F/DS is 5 Stars . I am a highly satisfied customer and user of this phone.Vinod Sharda",

        "body": "It has been over a month now since I have been using this phone. It was delivered to me on 23-08-2020; I'm writing this review on 10-10-2020.First off, I paid 16249INR for the 6gb variant which was possible after I applied for an exchange with Redmi note 4. I consider this - a steal deal.Here's what I have to say -1. Battery backup is excellent, lasts for an entire day with gaming and other operations.2. Camera quality is amazing; it also has a lot of professional modes for capturing great pictures.3. Fingerprint sensor may pose some issues over a period of time. In my case, device displays a message sometimes which reads 'Fingerprint sensor was blocked.....'4. Superb processor, something that Samsung is well known for.Supports shuffling between apps even during live gaming!5. I personally loved the blue light filter and always use the device in that mode. It Serves the purpose for prolonged use.6. Dolby Atmos sound feature works well with equally good quality earphones.7. Game booster is definitely an additional boon for people like me! It reads your battery usage and has a temperature control mechanism. I find it exceptional.I'm Akshay Jamkhedkar. Signing off.Ciao.",

        "body": "I'm using this phone for almost last 2 months so I would say I do know a lot about its performance.IN THE BOX: You will get Your Main smartphone and Charger(with c to c cable) NO BACK Cover so I had to buy a back cover and a screen protection. They should have provided a back cover for a Rs 19500 phone.In short: Build quality (3.5/5) is good but can be better in this price Range.It's weight is less than 200gms so works for me.Screen (5/5) sAmodled of samsung is best.Camera (4/5) is pretty good.Fingerprint(3.5 or 4) sensor is good but slow and its position sometimes makes things complicated.Battery: Excellent (15 to 100 in about 60-70 min don't know the real count but should be really close)Processor: (1.5/5) worst you can get for a 19k+ smartphone.Build quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê / 5 Smartphone design looks premium with glastic material but in the end its a polycarbonate back you will see fingerprints marks and have to clear it regularly to make sure it won't get scratches (I do use transparent a back cover bcz I love the phone's look)Screen ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5 You can't compare other phone's screen with Samsung its sAmoled screen is best in the segment.Fingerprint sensor: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5 Its good but not as fast as other phones in the same segment. Also, being it a side fingerprint sensor and also a power key you will have some problem but it also acts as a key features of the phone also you can do some interesting things from the key so overall its very good but i would have preferred on screen fingerprint sensor.Camera: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5 camera is also pretty good. I have uploaded camera click in 64MP and a macro shot. Same for selfie, So overall camera is good and comparable to other same segment phone.Battery: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê : If I didn't play any game the battery will go for a whole day. In fast charging it goes from 15 to 100 in about 60-75 min I think. I usually charge it before I go to sleep after switching off fast charging mode (fast charging made battery life smaller, go to youtube for more info)Processor: ‚≠ê/5  No good. My friends SD710 and SD712 works better than this. Even my sd660 sometimes play things better than this.I don't play much games(around 1-2 hr/ week) So after 2 weeks I installed 2 games, forget about rpg I sometimes play, this phone started to stuck in a game similar to candy crush (when all bubbles burst after completion) and i do close all apps from recent before playing and it's a 19k+ smartphone- _-So overall i will give 3. 5 or ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê to this smartphone as phone is not as good as it should be in this price range.",

I spend  most of my time watching movies and series and also spend 4 hours in google meet and upto 2 hours of pubg...all this in single charge i charge it only on the next day morning.3.Charging speed ...the charging is not super fast but it charges from 0 to 100 in 1hr 48 mins.4.cameraThe main cam is mind-blowing in day light and the night light is better than thw poco x2 but it can't be used anywhere.5.wideangle camThe main cam and wide angle shots have matching colours in sometimes both look great.the wide angle night mode is simply waste.6.The con material 9611 CHIPSET:9611 IS not the worst and its not the best, but its a myth than 9611 sucks , surfing through insta,fb, youtube ia buttery smooth.7.GamingAll games are running same as like its other competitors it may open after a 5sec delay that's the only change but it gives constant performance from start to endPubg cam be played smooth+extreme to Hdr+High but its not playable i have 6/128 varient. Smooth+ultra and hd +high has no problems8.The one ui. The phone is looking smooth and flappy becoz of the ui on top of it.The problems with its competitors like the redmi and realme are launching the successors within 3 months so there is no valuable updates for the mobile but samsung is taking good care of theri mobiles in updating it.The cons:1.No gorilla 5 protection.2.Dolby atmos only for the headphones3.selfie cam is not upto the mark.4.macro cam is totally waste ,the 2x zoom in main cam is way better than the macro.5.High sar valueThe verdict:If u are the one who plays games for hours and hours go for Snapdragon like 720g and 730g ..but if u are an average gamer who plays pubg for 2 hrs in a day it has no issues.Don't go for higher refresh rate lcd display the sAmoled experience is mind-blowing.If u want a mobile for long term use. just order it.Im completely satisfied.",

There is no inbuild data speed indicator and in my case the data speed seems to be a lot more slower than my previous phone.2. The exynos 9611 chipset is highly disappointing, my discord always seems to be cutting off mid calls and I am randomly existing out of games which starts from a gradual lag.3. The camera quality at night is terrible. It's worse than any vga camera at low light conditions.4. There are a lot of pre installed Samsung software some of which can be deleted and some not, which doesn't sum upto the stock android experience in any shape or form.5. There are no accessories in the box so you have to buy everything seperately. I mean we all know it's already overcharged don't we? On top of that it not even giving the experience it promises.",

It has a crisp Infinity-O AMOLED 6.5 inch display, and a big 6000 mAh battery with reverse charge bundled with a USB Type-C to Type-C cable, a Single Take camera feature with quad-camera and single-LED flash, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner along with the power button on the right (firsts for the Galaxy M series), USB Type-C port, 3.5mm audio jack, Speaker at the bottom, Secondary Microphone at the top, support for Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi ac, and GPS as well as dual 4G and VoLTE, a bundled 25W USB Type-C fast charger in the box (again a first for the Galaxy M series), has a somewhat new design that makes it stand out compared to its siblings in the Galaxy M series that makes Samsung Galaxy M31s look premium with a plastic back glossy finish which Samsung refers to as ‚ÄòGlasstic'.  A true value for money and something to keep for years.",

        "body": "Poor configuration mobile from Samsung ( Review after a month of use )Following are the reasons:1) They processor performs poorly causing the phone to hang all the time2) The screen touch sensitivity is poor and screen blanks out while making a  call. Need to double tap it every time to get the screen alive ( eg for a IVR call )3) Battery performance sub par.4) Too bulky and fat to use.5) Very poor sensitivity fingerprinter reader. For a left handed person makes  its use complicated due to positioning of the sensor.6) Camera is great quality but for Rs19,500 ie cost of phone I would rather buy a  DSLR camera to enjoy even better quality pics than get stuck with a phone  whose only ability is to click good photos. Remember a smartphones first and  primary use is to make phone calls and its smart use. Both which are sub par.My verdict ..... Please dont go purely on the star rating and reviews published on Amazon.Do your own research and decide.",

Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered. Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider..",

It's really a annoying  issue  I have faced with this phone. I have already complaint it to Amazon and asked for replacement with the same one as early as possible.

The phone cannot be replaced because the 14 day deadline is over, according to Samsung policy.

One day it will last without any problem.Speaker sound is just adequate. I am having Oppo F 11 which is having better sound quality.Finger print unlock works fast. One issue with side finger sensor is that using your left hand fingers is difficult compared to sensors in back.Overall avoidable.",

Image video quality is awesome. I am not a heavy user(moderate user) so I don't need high performance mobile this mobile does the job Great. I choose this mobile bcz using Samsung mobile for years and Samsung phones are great not loaded with unnecessary app like cleaners,power savers which you will find i all Chinese brands and I personally don't like Chinese brands mobile(not bcz of anti China)Samsung one UI is great,fast didn't found any lag in software as off now I seen some YT video which say mobile lag while multitasking. So I am using this mobile for 2 weeks and the battery üîãlast for 2days.It  drains only 50% through out day for Battery I will give 10 on 10. Let's talk about camera it has 4 cam(rear)one main sensor 64mp ,one wide angle,one depth sensor and one macro good image I am a professional in photography but I will say good cameras.Overall I like it little expensive but for Samsung one UI , other features and brand value its a good deal. Yes there are others mobiles comes with high performance(mostly Chinese)at low price. But I made final decisions on Samsung.",

        "body": "Bought this product after selling my Poco X2 due to battery issues. The phone is good but can not match Xiaomi or Redmi phones when compared to options available for customisation like dual app for all and not just WhatsApp fb, dual space, ainbuilt app lock, schedule battery saver,etc. I'm missing all those features in my M31s and the fingerprint sensor socks because it operates on it's own unlike Poco X2 where we had option of unlocking phone by pressing the sensor. So no accidental touches. Moreover the face unlock is also OK and does not work everytime.But nonetheless, I have to live with it now. So please weigh pros and cons before buying anything.",

Overall a decent non-chinese phone to buy.2. Normal processing speed is good. No lagging at the time of multitasking.3. Battery life is not up to the mark as per the battery size.4. Camera quality is decent. Picture quality is 90 %. Video quality is good.5. Some issues with built in app like calculator doesn't not work properly.6. #mejorissue As per my opinion finger print sensor is not good.. many of the times it does not recognize the finger print. And side panel sensor also creat problems while gaming or at the time of watching video.. randomly it gets touch.So overall its a good phone.. but not up to the mark..",

My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.",

Most importantly there was a specific audio issue that i looked up on the internet and found other users also are facing. There is a strange noise in the 3.5mm slot. Amazon was contacted for service personnel whose service was poor. he saw the phone was defective yet filed the report with amazon that all was okay. again a request was made for another service person which turned out to be the same as the previous person. this time he filed a report saying replacement needs to be sent. which took one week to come. Same issue with the replacement set. I sent it back which took more than 7 days to go to chennai from bengalore. where the phone was delivered. Still no money reflected in the bank account as i had purchased it on credit card. probably the worst experience ever with a phone.",

It has everything what you can ask for a phone below 20k.Best part is it's intelicam feature especially when you have a small kid and every minute moment matters it gives u few seconds video gif grey shade and pictures are amazing and clear. Second is it's AMOLED screen, watching videos movies feels so good.Side fingerprint sensor also works nice but in face recognition sometimes u may feel minor lag but it doesn't bother much.Battery is as they say it's a monster, even with fast charger you may feel it's charging slow because it's a big battery but it gives easily 40-48hrs back-up in full charge n full time use. I'm not a game freak so don't know how battery behaves with heavy gaming but yeah tried asphalt n shadow fight kinds of game it feels so good in this big screen it's fluidic.Honestly speaking it's a great phone n this blue color looks great but yes there are some moments of hanging sometimes but very few times. Due to big battery initially u may feel it's heavy but later on its ok.So in one line amazing AMOLED screen, great camera overall great phone.",

There were no issues with the phone when carrying out regular activities such as streaming, gaming, and multi-tasking as well. Your day-to-day experience, which would involve the opening of multiple apps in the background or browse through several tabs opened on Chrome should not face any hindrance.Build Quality:The¬†Samsung Galaxy M31s¬†has a somewhat new design that makes it stand out compared to its siblings in the Galaxy M series. It gets a 6.5-inch Infinity-O display with a hole-punch embedded camera centred at the top.Display:The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display. The display offers wide viewing angles and the larger screen makes watching movies/series and playing games a delight. Also, it has a blue light filter which reduces the strain on the eyes. There is also an option of dark mode.Fingerprint:This time Samsung¬†has gone with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy M31s, which is on the right along with the volume buttons.¬†Battery:The Galaxy M31s offers good battery life and lasted for close to two full days with my usage.Camera:The¬†Samsung Galaxy M31s¬†sports a quad-camera setup. The 64-megapixel primary camera has an f/1.8 aperture. There's also a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There is also a scene optimiser in the app.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs. 20,000.Thank you, Amazon for on-time delivery. Such a great experience!",

But sensitivity is good enough.Overall the phone is good. I feel Samsung has done well with this phone and the M series in total.The only problem I feel is the need to get a data cable as the charger cable supplied with the mobile is both side type C. So to connect to/charge from PC you need to get a separate data cable.",

Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 2 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. . So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",

The blue filter option can protect ur eyes while viewing in low light.Camera:The best till now. U can stop carrying ur DSLR henceforth if u have Samsung M31s.Single take is a good option in camera where you can capture the best moments and it gives best photos, videos and boomerang.Macro lens option is another plus point to capture the tiny things.In daylight the picture u get out of 64 mp camera is the best.Other best ones in camera are slow motion, hyperlapse, wide angle camera and lot more are there to explore here.Battery:No need to carry a powerbank if you have Samsung M31s. With one time charging you can do browsing, watching movies, playing music, clicking pictures etc. all these in a day and still battery will have another 25% charge.Fingerprint reader is very quick.After 1 month usage of this phone, my recommendation is just buy this phone.",

I was expecting that with this 6000mah battery, i won't need to charge the phone for 2 days.. but even after keeping the phone on 'moderate battery saver' mode, the battery is draining around 26 - 28 hours (just over a day).There are some lagging issues as well .. i mean seeing the screen getting freeze just after a month of purchasing it was really shocking.Screen clarity is good &Camera performance is also nice !",

After using for 50 days now, I am disappointed with the display and its touch sensitivity.  It hangs at least 3 times a day.

Brings out beautiful colour in both natural and artificial lighting.Processor is not made for extreme gaming but it can be played with medium level graphics although in long run it might affect the phone. Battery life is too good, not amazing as lately I found it draining little faster, however the battery optimization can pull the battery for more than 2 days for sure with normal usage",

I watch Youtube and other stuff in phone and also use it for social media.Other good things is it's camera. Picture quality is quite nice in 64MP mode. White balance is also good. Colours shown are natural.The Speaker on the phone is also according to my taste, i.e it has punchy sound. I dont like stereo speaker as they generally lack bass.Now talking about its display quality, as you know about samsung display, there are just AwsomeüíØ.Overall I can say it is the best phone for those who do not play heavy games on their phones.",

Nearly 40% of the time the other person are unable to call you.For the other person the phone is ringing whereas Samsung m31s doesn't even ring or show any missed call.This is a major problem and the company should test out their product before launching them.2. The 25W charger is small compared to 6000MAH battery. I agree the battery is big but the time taken to charge is 2 hours which is same for a non fast charging phone.3. Finger print is not that quick.4. Face unlock doesn't work most of the time.5. None of these issue is fixed in the software update.Pros:1. Camera is good.2. Battery life is good.3.

        "body": "I am writing this review after using M31s for more than one month. And my reviews based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.Very good build quality.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag during games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",

Charging has improved with the 25W Super Fast Charger. Display is awesome. The punch hole camera looks cool. The rear camera set up is good. There are a lot of camera modes, but 64MP camera isn't good enough. The zooming quality is not that good, especially when it's 10x. But still the AR zone, hyperlapse, super slow motion, makes it perfect. The quality of night mode is unbelievable, even your eyes won't see that much of light in night. The gaming performance is excellent. The back looks stunning with the Mirage Blue variant.Overall the phone is a real beast.Best phone I've ever experienced.",

        "body": "For the first time am using a samsung. For yrs I was using various asus smartphones. But currently no updated budget phones are available for asus so I switched to samsung and it was the only option. 8 gb 128 variantReview after seven days. A good device at this price point. Not for heavy gamers. But excellent for a medium gamers and top for normal users. Real racing 3 work perfectly without any frame miss or lagWell engineered device. Balanced hardware combination with suitable chipset for allrounder performance. With no doubt u can purchase if u a looking for a best class mobile at this time.A excellent display as usual seen in samsung.Side mounted fingerprint reader is non conventional but it will be handy to use within few days. Very efficient since the reader size is less than the quarter of normal rear mount reader and perfectly works. No lag6000mah battery is not a wonder for me bcuz i was using 5000 mah asus max for last 4 yrs. But the fastcharger is mindblowing. Using for last 7 days. Never fully charged till now. Excellent battery life. 59% of battery charge is enough for 2 days of normal use. I mean that much excellent the battery. Each and every percent of charge is used efficiently and optimized manner. No heavy battery drain or heating on play games like Real racing 3.Rear cam is awesome. But frnt cam is poor. Over beautification is there in the front cam. And no option to change or vary that. For frnt cam 32 mp is just a number i think. Even realme's 8mp frnt is more clear.Overall a good phone with durable hardware so that i hope it can last for atleast 3 yrs when compared to those chinese phone.And also hope there will be no performance deterioration with time as the Samsung is one of the trusted brand.Dark mode is a better option but lacks the split screen option so for the entire 6.5 inch screen we are supposed to use a single app at a time.Personally, lack of led indication affect me lot bcuz don't know if there is any msgs arrived until i take the device in hand. Led indication is not available for almost all recent devices. Like 'always on display' feature, a in-display indication can be provided if samsung cares the users.Light sensor is very very excellent. Adaptive brightness works efficiently.Biometric updating is great. For every 72 hrs if we are not using pin or pattern unlock system demand to use it so that no chance to forget the pattern. That's good. Double tap lock is not available but double tap on is there...Able to add only 3 fingerprints thats a limitation. No inbuilt power management app for costumized power plan even 4yrs back devices provides those features. Network switch is great. In screen lock is available during gaming...in built game booster so on...Overall a just good wow phone.. not for a wooow... worth for the money. Greater fone in low budget range.",

Look are very good but the back is made up of plastic so it will be a pain. But apply backcover then you are good to go.",

If you are a gamer, you can just choose the game launcher that dedicates a specific amount of RAM to the application of your choosing. Thus, maximizing the performance.M31S also comes with one of the fastest fingerprint sensor.The camera quality is outstanding but, some improvements are still needed with the scene optimization. But overall, it is good.The only problem is it's usb. You need a type c to type c cable for this or else, the charger will be rendered useless.Overall, it's a perfect fit for someone like me who needs their phone to last all day long (whilst scrolling through several social media sites and feeds the whole day).",

        "body": "If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.",

Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable. Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive. Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered. Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider",

Sometimes even if I'm sitting right next to the wifi it shows 1 bar less. And the speed drops considerably. Speed tests indicate really fast speeds but while using the apps it doesn't work at an efficient speed. Especially apps such as YouTube,  whatsapp etc. This im guessing is a software issue. The app freeze is also a software issue.",

Haven't been able to test the rear camera that much due to the pandemic situation. Phone is slow and hangs when using multiple apps and switching between them. It also hangs when you turn off the screen while using an app and then turn it back on. Sometimes one has to click several times on action items to get a response. Fingerprint scanner takes an entire second for thumbs. I ran all the benchmark tests and this phone fared very poorly for it's price bracket. I had Redmi Note 7 Pro before this and even that fared significantly better. All I can say is that it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade for me. Battery backup is good though, as is the display.",

Battery, if you are non gamer the battery will last about 2 days2. SAMOLED display. Unlike LCD, OLED looks much vivid & contrasting. Perfect viewing experience.3. Face recognisation & fingerprint scanner works so fast4. Slim bezels, hence it makes phone lighter as well as easy to hold5. In 97 minutes, it charges from 0 to 100% (6000mAh) Thats insane6. U will get 25 watt fast charger7. Yesss... there's a headphone jack8. It supports Dolby atmos, which gives u perfect surround experience9. Both rear and front camera supports 4k video recordingCons1. Low light camera is average. Okay, considering this price range its good2. Missing secure folder3. There's no IP rating, so keep it away from water and dust.4. There's no support for samsung pay either.ConclusionIf u aren't a hardcore gamer, then u should really go for this phone.",

Unlock mechanism is not very reliable. Finger prints sometimes don't recognize and face unlock is hit and miss.2. Though camera specs are top notch, the camera app fails to make use of the hardware properly. I have not tried other camera apps, but the Samsung provided default app is ordinary. I've used iOS for sometime and the seamless transition between multiple sensors is something Samsung can try to emulate. Even worse, they don't even know how to let other apps (like WhatsApp) use the cameras.",

I just fell in love with a deep black display having an always-on mode which feels like something special. VR experience with the mobile is just out of the world. You won't wanna back to your real world again. It comes with  One UI 2 OS, the segment in which Samsung has improved a lot. The camera improved from the last best version of M30s in the segment. Technically the lag in capture time with the main primary rear camera has been eliminated. The one single shot with multiple types of captures is an interesting feature added. Battery life is the beast having 6000mAh as expected having a 25W charger. I found one basic minor cons: sometimes face & fingerprint sensor doesn't work well as the competitors in the market. Overall, if you wish to have a phone in the mid-price segment this phone is a balanced one for you leaving away the Chinese controversy.",

        "body": "I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. Bought this phone during the first sale in august. I am an old Samsung user and had switched to Redmi and realme in between, but didn't liked the experience. I am a student, heavy user and techy person but don't play games. My basics needs are CAMERA, SCREEN AND BATTERY with a great UI. All my needs are full filled by M31s. Now I am dividing the review into pros and cons . I have not given the remaining 1 star because of the cons.PROS1. The screen is actually very good. The sAmoled panel is mind blowing. Although I am used to the sAmoled screen ,since I am an old  Samsung user üòÖ. The dark mode is mind blowing .... Perfect blacks. The punch hole cut is very small and clear.... In LCD panels the cut out is bleeding. Also the chin and bezels are very small.2. Camera is excellent. I think no one offers that kind of camera quality in this price segment. Some samples are given ...... But I have clicked many good shots .3. Battery back up is just great. I am a heavy user and most of my consumption is from YouTube , whatsapp and Google meet . But iget a screen time of 10  to 14 hours .... which lasts 1.5 days and its insane.4. Built quality is good . Looks are great . Feels lighter than redmi note 9 pro and realme 6. But no cover is provided , so orderd a solimo cover and screen guard along with the phone.Speakers are loud and clear. Fingerprint scanner is also good.5. The software experience is very good with One UI. Although it's the core version of the One UI. It's equally great with some compromises. The UI is intelligent and handles the phone well. When you will use the One UI you will get to know that how other brands are implementing some key features of One UI in their own UIs, which Samsung is providing from years.6. RAM management is awesome. It keep 15 to 20 apps opened in the memory for 4 to 5 hours.... literally ram is well managed .CONS1. No protective gear is provided with a 0hone worth 20 k.2. The processor is well optimized for the phone and there are minor or no lags in the UI experience. But still it sometimes feels laggy in some cases of app opening which came be overcome by software updates. But I can tell you that exynos 9611 is not that weak as claimed by some YouTubers. It does my daily tasks smoothly.3. No dedicated haptics feedback while typing or long touch. I had to enable the haptics vibration by SETEDIT APP. The Samsung keyboard is excellent but I use Gboard because it supports haptics feedback.4. The 25 watt provided charger takes 55 minutes from 5% to 50% and around 2 hoursto charge from 5% to 100% in cool conditions of evening time ( charging time varies with room temperature). Samsung should have provided a faster charger but they even provide the same 25 W charger with their flagships üòÖ.Final verdictIf you are a person like me who needs a phone with great camera, battery and screen, then go for it.üëçüèº",

I'm using this phone for more than a month. I have decided that this is the perfect time for me to give genuine review. BELIVE ME! Exynos 9611 processor is not at all the worst idea, it performs similar to the Snapdragons or Abionics or helios. So without any turbulence go for this phone.

        "body": "I had been a redmi fan from 2016 it self. I have used 3 redmi sets since then.as I needed a new set, surely I would have gone for redmi note 9 pro max but due to the anti China movement I started looking for other options. Finally I went for samsung m31s. It had just launched.  I am writing the review after almost 2 months of use.Let's start with cons:1) The punch hole camera could have been on the side. That would have made it look even better.2) The plastic body at the back could have been replaced with the glass back, giving it more premium feel as in redmi note 7 pro. Also it is prone to scratches. So better use cover.Pros:1)Performance and os : What I was worried about most was the performance as it does not have snapdragon chip set. Nd I have been a huge fan of it. But to my surprise, the performance is fast and I can multitask with ease. There is no lag. And it comes with one ui. I must say it is fun and I am enjoying it. And since the last two months I haven't seen a dip in the performance.2) Display: It has sAMOLED display.  I dont think i need to say anything about the quality of display. Its much better than ips display. I even prefer 60Hz AMOLED display over 120Hz ips display. The colour combination is just mind blowing. And the notches are super thin. It feels like you have just the screen in the whole phone and ya the puch whole camera. But the experience is awesome.3) Camera: I think the camera is best in this segment, considering the combination it offers. Micro mode is just super. I have taken such amazing photos with it. The main 64MP camera is also good. The pictures come out a bit natural after processing. This depends on personal preference. But for me this works well. There is always option of smoothing if you like that. The ultra wide camera is not the best but considering the price range I would say it does a pretty good job. The depth sensor does a good job with portrait mode. The intelli-Cam simgle take is a new feature that samsung has added. It does help to have multiple shotstaken at once. In short I am happy with the camera performance.4) Fingerprint and face unlock: Fingerprint unlock does suffer with sweaty fingers. Otherwise its fast. Face unlock is even faster. I really like the speedand accuracy  face unlock feature.5) Battery life: It has huge battery. I am a heavy user even then my phone asks for more than 24 hrs on a single charge. Charging the phone to 100% takes some time though.6) Design: I liked how the phone feels in hand. Front of the phone is just awesome. Plastic could have been replaced with glass as I already mentioned.Overall, I am  ery hally with the set. I have even tried one plus nord and without comparing the price, I still think this one is better. I would say this phone is the best in segment below 30k. Its even 10k cheaper and it has stood up in all the aspects. I am really loving the experience.",

The charging speed is also fast.3.PERFOMANCE:-The explosion 9611 is an old processor but paired with 6 gb of ram it provides enough for heavy gaming.4.DISPLAY:-It is the best I have seen at this price range it looks awesome from all angles. The cutout is also so small.5.DESIGN:-The design is pretty good compared to older m series phones. The glossy finish looks awesome.6.BUILD:-The build quality is also good. The fingerprint sensor is also fast and perfectly placed. For a 6000 mah battery it is pretty light.So far after a week of usage I haven't found any cons.",

My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier.

        "body": "Decent for day to day use but with some irritating issues and some useful functionality miss.Phone has a powerful battery, no doubt about that. Where my earlier phones with 3200 mAh battery used to drain twice a day, this phn doesn't break a sweat it easily lasts for 1.5 day. Although 6000mAh battery increases the weight of the device significantly.Look, Display and design of the phone are amazing. Looks good at both front and back. Gradient bacl gives phone a premium lookMemory management : Samsung does not live up to expectations here. I was using a 6GB Realme 3 pro before this but never had  my phone freeze or hang, but this \"Monster\" by Samsung is not so good to handle applications, I have seen high RAM consumption and device do hang sometimes which is quite irritating given it being an 8 GB memory phoneFingerprint sensor : probably most impactful irritating thing with this phn is the side button fingerprint sensor. It is not very smooth, takes time, since surface area is small, finger misses it many a time, and sometimes if my finger touches it while picking up the phone it gets disabled for 30 seconds or so. Surely never going for side button sensor ever again.Camera: Ohh the biggest disappointment. From the setup which it boasts of quality of pictures is not up to the mark. Night mode is not the best in segmentMissing Utility apps: When some companies are offering many utility features that can be useful, this phone lacks such features . Team can research by looking at some other phones and introduce new features to increase utility.So by the overall review it is not a phone I would buy if I had any non-China product with decent reputation. But since we do not have any other option I think it is a phone I can live with. Hopefully we will have better Indian players in this segment and then we can have some improvements",

Even the polycarbonate Glastic coat on the mobile makes it feel louder and premium. The most limelighting feature of the device is its 6.5' inches SuperAmoled Display which is nothing as regular but a topmost potent display which no other smartphones in this price range offers. The phone has excellent cameras bringing life to its liveliest! Even the processor of the phone is powerful enough for all daily activities and decent gaming providing a lag free experience! The battery of the phone is simply a  beast in itself by virtue its a 6000mAH batytery proving a 2 day battery life! Ultimately the phone is best in all its components. Thanks much for reading!",

It has a few good additions to it. The quality of images is nice. However, not radically better than my previous phone.2. On paper, specifications are good. Biometric scans are good addition, however many times login issues are being encountered by me, so I feel it needs technical improvements.3. The phone has a good design and is generally eye catching. The transfer of data proved to be smooth with Samsung Switch.4. Usage wise got bored of it within a day. Nothing very exciting or new in usage experience.5. Noticeable lags and slowness encountered even with basic usage, no game scenario.6. Biggest drawback is battery. The charger takes an eternity to charge, and seems to be lagging ages behind in technology as compared to Oppo, One Plus, etc. Just for this point, I am not too happy with my purchase.7. However, it is not Chinese. But I feel based on my usage that other options may be explored.",

The performance of the phone is average since it has Exynos processor ,which is good processor if you are not gaming alot. the battery backup is ULTIMATE , it last for more than 20 hours of continues usage and even it charging is faster ,all thanks to 25W fast charger. The camera performance is ultimate , the picture quality is very good . but the only flaws i have noticed in terms of video is that it doesn't has 60 fps recording.The biggest advantage is that it has work mode were you can secure your important work related files ,contacts ,photos ,etc & it is SECURED BY KNOX.BUT OVERALL IT'S  ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCT INTRODUCED BY SAMSUNG.",

Processor is slow to be frank, have seen lags quite a time in app opening and network connectivity too. Overall it is a mix of both pros and cons.

The fingerprint sensor is very fast and unlocks the phone in fraction of seconds. The battery is just wow. I use it fully and still it is not drained at the end of the day. The camera quality is amazing. If you know how to use the pro mode then you will take way better shots. I play a lot of games but this phone doesn't lag at all. This is the best phone I have used so far.",

After connecting it stucks and don't play songs, videos etc. consistently and gets disconnected continuously and sound is not coming smoothly. Music is continuously getting hanging. While playing  songs on Bluetooth speakers when I use Gmail Facebook  Whatsapp etc. Apps  the music/songs hangs and stop playing music and songs can not run smoothly. I am very very disappointed to see this that I cannot  enjoy my favorite music and songs. When you start typing  to text message the music stops. When you open any app music stops. This phone has major problems. I didn't try camera as I did get stuck in the Bluetooth Connectivity problem from the very beginning.It has 6 gb RAM but it is hanging from the first time I set up this phone.  I am a music lover I use Bluetooth headphones  and Bluetooth  home theater speakers very much and I am very very disappointed  after buying  this phone. After contacting Amazon they told me to wipe data and reboot phone but after doing this also the Bluetooth  connectivity problem persists.The same Bluetooth home theater speakers working smoothly and fine with my old phone  Lenovo k4 note and my wife's  phone realme 3 pro and my mom's phone Nokia  5.1 plus but this phone cannot play music after  connecting it to Bluetooth speakers. Inspite of having octa core processor Phone is hanging also while I did not install too much apps and did not install any single game. Worst mobile purchase in my whole life. I am regretting my decision to trust and buy Samsung m31s. I should have purchased realme or redmi or vivo or oppo. So guys don't purchase Samsung phones.Network data speed also slow as compared  to realme and redmi phones. Face recognition  and finger print reader is also not working as should have worked. The biggest  drawback is Bluetooth connectivity  which is mostly used by mobile users to call and to listen songs and to watch videos.Please Don't buy and save your money. I am going to return this phone and get my money refunded because I don't want any replacement of Samsung  phone back in my hands.  I could not give 0 ratings that's why I am giving 1 star rating. I am completely dissatisfied from the performance  of this phone.Total waste of time and money. I wasted my whole day to adjust this Bluetooth  problem but failed.Amazon please help me.",

And guess what all these thing happened just after the launch of this Monstor.Not only i'm doing all my official work on this phone. I also Bingwatch all my favorite shows & movies on M31s big crystal clear screen.also being a video creator I make all my videos with this phone, means camera was one of the main reason I bought this phone, and in this section it has defeated all his competiters.Even all my video editing happen on this phone only, without any hustle, so no more laptop heat on my lap.Only problem I have with this is phone is, I wish it had come with any headphone, so I didn't have to bought them from the market. But overall samsung has truly done some wonder in this price range.",

Even though there are Some BLOTWARES i Can assure that all apps that come can be UNINSTALLED. I can GIVE 4.5/5 FOR THIS PHONE",

It just works like a 4000 Mah and my device charged for a good 2 hr 30 mins for 100%Seriously are you kidding Samsung. Who waits for charging upto 2 hrs and 25w charger doesn't do any good work. It's just another charger and the optimisation in the Samsung shockingly not good in this device whereas in my previous M31 and S8+, they are efficienctly good2.Camera - Although Camera Output is GoodThe problem lies with the shutter speed. If you have to take a pic then you have to uphold the pose for good 3-4 sec üôÑ Disaster to say the least. Yes Outputs are great but why this lag. And if you are using flash then good luck. The flash needs another 1 more second tym to operate and previews too take time to load.. Don't know why all this happening in a mobile with 6GB RAM3 Processor - even though I'm not a heavy gamer, I play pubg at tyms but the game play was very very bad and screen fluctuating at lowest settings. I know about this processor but it has to perform at least once in a while for gaming but it doesn't perform.Display too not the Regular AMOLED you see in High end devices.. just for name sake it's a AMOLED deviceI Bought this mobile and sold it within 15 days with loss of 3k. Only recommend for the people who just use for calls, WhatsApp and Instagram but why would you spend 20k If you only use them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

        "body": "Honest review for a Perfect Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than one month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",

Finally you will give up by adding a pattern lock.iv) Samsung and it's authorised service centres are horrible and they are clueless about any of the phone issues and they will keep on seeking time once you visit them.v) Don't buy this phone thinking it has a very good camera.vi) All specifications of the phone are just on paper and not a reality.I bought this phone thinking the set is Indian made and after buying this handset I understood why chinese made phones are still occupying a major part of the market.",

        "body": "Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M31s after using this phone approximately 12 days one thing wanna say if you are finding something from a Global brand with honest processing go ahead with Galaxy M31s.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is also faster in night as well.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots are more than awesome. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Amazon for Safe delivery.üòäüòä",

The ultra wide and the depth are better compared to its rivals, and the macro camera is not an afterthought or just an additional camera with cheap quality, it produces great images.4) Build: The plastic frame doesn't feel cheap and the plastic back has a premium looking gradient but could be smudged very easily.Cons:1) The weight of this phone is a bit heavy and pit on a case and it will be a bit bulky too which may pose a problem to users with small hands.2) The processor is average but as this phone houses huge amounts of fast ram it feels pretty fast while multitasking.ADVISES WHILE BUYING:1) The mirage black colour is the one to go for In my opinion as rhe blue vacant looks a bit cheaper.2) The base ram and storage options are sufficient for a medium user.",

        "body": "Fingerprint sensor:-Fingerprint sensor is good but not so fast. And once in everyday to unlock the mobile, it asks the security password.Battery life:-Battery life is awesome.I saw one or two movies daily.And I use camera for video recording for youtube channel. Sometimes for 2 hours continuously but the battery percentage drop is just 20 to 30%.And I play games in Mx player daily.And I use phone for normal use like calls, internet browsing, reading books, and watching youtube videos.But I used to I charge only once a day even.And for charging it takes nearly 2 hours.Camera quality:-And comes to camera quality I upload some images taken by samsung m31s. You can see it. And for video recording for youtube videos i use open camera app because in camera app given by samsung i didn't find exposure lock. So thats why I use open camera app.And if you want to see the video quality, check this link https://youtu.be/W0encosL-gUAnd while video recording morethan 1.5 to 2 hours. Phone gets heat lightly at the backside. But after stop video recording within few minutes the heat lasts away.Overall performance:-And coming to overall performance, this mobile is good. Good sound, good battery life, good display.Problems that I face:-1. While reading pdf or using samsung notes app and some other apps, I leave the mobile aside, its locked. After when i unlock the mobile, the app didn't interact for my touches like swiping, or tap to write something. At that time when go to recent apps menu and again click on app from the recent app menu. Again the app works.2. Just today, I have a notification from google play about tez shot game. And while I playing that game I face some frame drops but I don't know thats the mobile problem or app problem.3. And comes to sound quality. It was good but almost sound comes in between the volume levels of 4 to 10. When I place at level 4. The sound was too low and cant able to hear. And while changing volume level at one level the sound drops much.Finally I am totally satisfied with this mobile and I love this mobile. Because it satisfying all my needs like good camera, big battery, amoled display, side mounted fingerprint sensor, fast charging, good speaker.Thank you",

I run a company and I was looking for a mobile which can be with me without any maintenance and slowing down for at least 3 years. I cannot afford to change mobile phones every year and I'm already using an iPhone 6s Plus.I was confused with this mobile, Oneplus Nord and realme 6 pro and finally purchased this mobile.Pros:1) The screen quality is Awesome. it is super AMOLED and no less than the flagship series of Samsung.2) The battery life is the second-best point of this phone. The battery lasts at least 1.5 days even with heavy usage.3) Samsun One UI is also great. There are no ads, unlike MI, Oppo and Vivo phones. It offers a lot of customizations and one the easiest to use.4) The camera is not that bad, the camera is not that good as OnePlus Nord but it is not that bad. It has an average camera.5) No Heating issues.6) It can run games easily. I won't say it is the best at handling games but if you are not a gamer, you can run any game on this mobile easily.7) The speaker is big enough.8) Audio quality is simply unmatched, it has Dolby Atmos and with earphones it is awesome.Cons:1)The biggest Con that no will tell you is - it has no Haptik feedback and also Vibration sucks.2) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is not worth it. It is really bad.2) Plastic back is very bad and you need to cover it to save it from damages.3) No earphones, Screen guard and the back cover comes with the phone. Please get the cover on the same day as there can be micro scratches on the phone.4)The phone is heavy and a bit thick.",

First is the fingerprint sensor which is not so functional and does not recognize generally. Secondly a more modern processor would have been better like those offered by the competitors.  Third , a plastic case is generally included in almost all other brands and in the A series as well . The standard earphones included in A series models are also missing here.If not for these minor inconveniences this smartphone would have been in my point of view an amazing product.  Still this phone is a great deal and I highly recommend it for those people who enjoy Samsung products like me.",

Exynos 9611 is good processor but it cannot beat the competition with snapdragon processors. But overall the company's one UI 2.1 is very optimized and stable so you will not face any lag.Thats all about my experience with this phone.Thankyou.",

        "body": "The Samsung Galaxy M31s marks a small upgrade in the design language that Samsung has employed in its M-series lineup so far. While the basic plastic look and feel of the device remain largely the same as its predecessors, the Galaxy M31s opts for a gradient coloring on the back which gives the device its own identity. The Mirage Black unit that we received starts off with a silver-chrome color towards the top and merges into a black color towards the bottom. The chrome color is a little difficult to capture on camera, and the gradient is a lot more gradual in the middle than what the device renders suggest. The back also has a glossy finish.The mid-frame, back panel, and buttons on the device are all polycarbonate. It‚Äôs clear that Samsung uses polycarbonate to bring down the cost of the device, and we are largely content with the decision as long as the savings are passed onto consumers. Plus, polycarbonate phones weigh less, meaning that you don‚Äôt really notice the massive 6,000mAh battery weighing your wrists down.The front of the Samsung Galaxy M31s is also occupied by the 6.5‚Ä≥ FHD+ Super AMOLED display, which is very good. The only disappointment that I had was the lack of a higher refresh rate‚Äîwe can spot several phones with 90Hz and even 120Hz refresh rate in this price segment in India, so Samsung seriously needs to consider an upgrade in this department. As far as viewability and other display qualities are concerned, I am quite content with what the Samsung Galaxy M31s has to offer. Samsung‚Äôs AMOLEDs are some of the best in the market, and the Galaxy M31s is in the same boat.The bottom of the Galaxy M31s houses the 3.5mm headphone jack, the USB Type-C port, and the speaker hole. Several phones in this segment have retained the 3.5mm headphone jack, and it‚Äôs good to see that Samsung has, too. The phone does not have any official claims on water or dust resistance, which also isn‚Äôt an uncommon omission at this price range.The Samsung Galaxy M31s comes with the Exynos 9611 SoC that employs 4 ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz and 4 ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.7GHz. If this configuration sounds familiar to you, that is because Samsung has shipped several devices with the same setup, including the Galaxy A50, Galaxy A51, Galaxy M30s, and the Galaxy M31. The only ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù that Samsung has afforded from the Galaxy M31 to the Galaxy M31s is the fact that the latter comes with 128GB of storage as standard and gets an 8GB RAM option.The Samsung Galaxy M31s runs on Android 10 with One UI Core 2.1 on top, which is an upgrade as its predecessor runs One UI Core 2.0. One UI Core is a stripped-down version of the complete One UI experience that is present on Samsung flagships, and Samsung ships this ‚ÄúCore‚Äù version on its budget and lower mid-range devices. The Core variant loses out on features such as Samsung Pay and Secure Folder. You also lose out on the system-wide built-in screen recorder, though a workaround for that is to add the app you want to screen record to the Samsung Game Launcher which allows you to screen record in games.HENCE THE BEST IN CLASS BEST IN PRICE",

Camera is nice. No heating issues. All android phones look and feel the almost the same so there is nothing to get excited about them. Battery was better than hawai 8x .

Those are more comfortable to use as compared to this one built in power button.AMOLED display is quite nice.Now the UI and Processor. I didn't like the Samsung UI as such. Like there could be little tweaks here and there to improve the experience.It's got Exynos 9611. Now I'm a regular user, there's no heavy usage, no gaming, yet my phone hangs quite often.The Processor and UI matter the most to me and I'm not quite happy with these so hence 3 stars.Note: If you're in hot temperature area and using any video call app or any heavy app, make sure to remove the cover of your phone, otherwise it will overheat.Just experienced it yesterday. The device promted warning, which is good feature. Good work on that Samsung.",

        "body": "I bought this M31s 8gb Variant for two reasons.Made in India and Longer battery life. So it serves in that area.Pros :1. Samsung2. Good battery life. two days for my moderate plus use. Quick charging is efficient but with only box-provided cable.3. Screen is good. Gorilla Glass 3 delivers so far after the use of 2 months.Cons:1. NOT ORIGINAL COLORS. My family member has Samsung S8+ and that has only a 12MP camera but way better results. Even green looks green in That S8+ phone but this M31s phone has its own interpretation of all colors which is far from realistic. A HUGE DULL MOMENT for the Brand Samsung.See the attached images: S8+ one, Pink, Is the original color of the cloth sheet. M31s show as dull Red.No filters, No Flash. All same conditions. Worst is, you take the photo, and until you don't compare you do not realize but it leaves a completely different memory trail for years after those pics taken. Far from real.2. For an 8gb RAM, its good but does not feel as smooth and fast as the 8gb One-plus 7t I felt. Probably the Exynos effect.3. Speaker is bad and Low volume. On 2nd day It gave me a really ODD output while talking to someone on loudspeakers. Like Voice is coming through underwater, gargled. So I contacted Amazon and they set up some expert in-person review. That person calls and says it could be a poor network. NOT SIR. It's not that big of a deal for me I don't use it much. I decided to return if it happens again but it hasn't.4. The previous phone I had Vivo v11pro and that gave continues Jio HotSpot without interruption but when I put that sim in this phone, the connection would suddenly drop and then get reconnected. Happened multiple times. Pubg would just get disconnected unexpectedly in the middle of the gameplay. You can imagine. So now I am having to keep the old Vivo phone only for HotSpot purposes and can not sell. Have the Jio dongle too but then I can not use the number for calls and texts.5. Exynos UI is sort of old and annoying at times I have learned, my first time using. Like I could not enter a person's contact with more than 10 characters in the first name. That has resolved with an update but was really odd of that limitation in a 2020 released phone.6. They should ve included Rs. 50 TPU cover that could cost them less than Rs. 18 if ordered in Samsung level bulk. I ordered one online for Rs. 150 from Amazon and it is uneven from Edges and what not. Looks ugly.7. Macro Mode is Fake. Very much not delivered as expected as one of the High-End Micro results. But Single Take could be fun.8. Framerate could be 90fps instead of 60fps. Least Samsung could do while Rog is reaching 144fps at only double the price.9. Fingerprint sensor could be bigger or better. Sometimes it goes off the rail just after not being able to detect in the first couple of touches, and then gives time out of 35 some seconds to try again, at which point you unlock with the passcode.Again, Bad camera results in the area of Colors and display, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",

        "body": "I mostly like the camera which has a lot of great features, the main part is the awesome battery lasts up to 12 hours of continuous usage of apps and games. Usually, I start using my phone morning 7 and it lasts till evening 7 and the 25 W superfast charger charges my phone within 1hr 40min, and it uses Exynos 9 octa 9611 it uses a 10 nm semiconductor which is a little bit old processor even it is old it performs great because it has multiple core support(4x2.39Hz with 9 octa-core) and Mali G72 mp3 GPU so in gaming pubg mobile can be played in HD High without lag and it gives seamless multitasking you can switch between games and other apps easily with a single Slide Navigation bar gestures). I have not used mobiles with Samsung's Exynos processor, I just brought this as a try but this amazed me. The fingerprint scanner and face unlock is very fast and the display is great, it comes with an infinite-o-super Amoled display and I can watch my favorite series and movies on Netflix and Prime video in 1080p and I can experience the Dolby atmos in wired and Bluetooth headphones or earphones The gradient color and design is elegant I love it so I've brought a transparent case and it is also secured by Knox you can see in settings and also when the phone gets booted up. I heard that this was the competition for one plus Nord, by my experience, it does with the camera and battery and other things are the same. This is the best phone at this budget.",

Its an amazing phone within the budget. Camera, display, battery, fingerprint reader are doing exceptionally well. I just give a honest review based on the usage of my phone. You guys can check out the photos I click using m31s on my Instagram page - abhikiran66FINGERPRINT :The only flaw I found in fingerprint reader is that due to new position of this finger print reader, unknowingly finger gets placed on the sensor by me or people using my phone and It gets blocked for 60 seconds and coming to face detection for unlocking the phone it isn't working properly, infact it isn't working at all in my phone compared to Samsung m20.BATTERY:I have no complaint against battery. Its  6000mh battery. My phone ran for 2 days continously with one charging.I love the new idea of type c to type c charger.Phone is getting charged really fast.  The onky flaw I experienced is I cannot connect my phone with the charger. I had to buy a new type c cable.CAMERA:when it comes to the camera, I just loved it. As a photographer I really like camera features they are offering in this budget. I'm gonna add some pictures which I clicked from the phone",

The Galaxy M31s doesn‚Äôt look too flashy, but I am okay with that. But Samsung does cut some corners to keep the price down. Like the Galaxy A51, the M31s‚Äôs back panel is made of plastic with a glass-like finish, but you probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to differentiate. Still, the build quality is solid, though there is no waterproof rating.",

A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.",

        "body": "Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAMHonest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than 1 month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",

My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.",

I bought samsung for a durable brand but what is the use when it lags from the first day onwards.Wight: I would not complain about the weight because i knew it is a heavy phone as compared to other and thick too. Just because i knew it will be thick and heavy i will not question that.Built quality: Glastic back, its lools beautiful but even with the ear peice sound back is vibrating, i was shocked with all these. Even with the use of back cover it was vibrating in the less volume of the earpeice.Heat: With a normal usage upper portion near the camera in the back it gets bit heated.I am thinking of returing it as it keeps on lagging even it is updated with the latest update.",

It takes approximately 1.5hr to get fully charged.Display is awesome as M series have. Camera is very nice. It can be zoom in and out in front camera.Overall I will give M31s 8.9/10.",

But the inclusion of 25W charger in box is the deal maker for those who worry about endurance practical usage.Fingerprint reader is not as practically good as it is technically excellent. The whole idea of side mounted scanner, that too on embedded in the power button, is neither intuitive as rear mounted, nor versatile as under display scanner. But it's fast, expected of the final generation capacitive scanner.One UI is great if you are coming from other non stock options, but headache inducing when you come from stockish phones like OnePlus.I cannot say for sure whether for the price it's the best deal. But it's not immediately regretted. It's a well rounded square phone.",

But it is running PES 2020 smoothly and I am not facing any lag issues.11)Knox Security is absent though it is mentioned when phone is booted.12)Build Quality is improved as compared to M31.13)NFC is missing which is used for Samsung Pay and is also helpful in connecting headphones.14)Overall phone is very good and it is always better than \"Chinese branded\" phones.15)Don't go for it if you are into heavy gaming.",

Tries to install a lot of bloat during setup. If you like Samsung's ecosystem features then this shouldn't stop you.- The fingerprint sensor isn't as sharp as it could have been & is hit & miss. Being on the edge gives it a learning curve as your finger needs to be positioned correctly to cover the sensor.",

After working tirelessly for 25 yrs and even in pandemic I was accused of being careless thanks to Samsung. I have lost my patient reports, was not reachable, went to service station exposing myself to 20 people as Samsung has no social responsibility of maintaining social distancing in 80 Square foot space.I am throwing all my samsung things and will not ever buy anything from Samsung anymore and I advise everyone the same.Thanking youDr Sameer",

There Is Also One Thing That I Noticed In This Device Is That When I Open The Applications like Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. It Runs Very Well But When I Close That Applications I Can See Some Glitch Effect On Icon Of Particular Applications. I'm Not Using Fingerprint Reader So I Don't Know How Efficiently It Is Works In This Device But Instead Of That I'm Using Facial Recognition, It Is Impressively Work Great But There Are Seen Some Poor Performance When I Try To Use In Night Or Dark Places.

Fingerprint sensor at side is good but now when I have put on cover it is little difficult. I expected a back cover and a tempered glass from seller to provide as free which you can get when you buy from local market. overall it's really good phone only thing I'm seeing that battery is still draining little faster than expected.

But it doest not live upto the expectations. It has the Sony IMX sensor, but it doest not produce true colors. If i take a pic of a red color, it shows you light orange tint. I was so excited with the marketing hype and bought it. The processor utterly disappointed me. At this price range(below this in fact) other brandings are coming up with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chipset, i still dont understand why samsung imposing their own Shitset to the user. People say, it is good for daily usage, i din even ay high graphical games, u can even notice the lag while switching apps. The processor is a complete garbage.And coming to the back panel, i know they cant provide glass to maintain the weight balance, but atleast it cud have been improved. It is very prone to scratches. It feels as if ur own fingers could damage the back.The Super Amoled Display is still protected with Gorilla Glass 3 while other are using GG5. The main plus point is the display itself. Buttery smoothy(only when processor is that smoother of course).Another main problem is the signal reception, its very poor.Dont expect battery to last for 2 days as Tech People are hyping it. Its just one day battery.And it feels as if its over priced. 16k wud have been a great deal.I bought this with somuch of excitement and simply it ruined me. Ive used it for one month and sold. If you still want samsung and can afford a lil more, go for m51.",

The weight of this phone is quiet balanced that you never feel bulky. Media play, video streaming looks gorgeous thanks to amoled display. Previously before buying i thought of performance may be an issue because of exynos processor, but trust me if you are not a gaming person like me phone runs very fast and smooth. Camera quality,  battery life is also good fingerprint reader is very fast.  One more important thing the phone has no heating issue till date.",

It will run through a day.could have been¬† much better. After 1st sept update the battery backup reduced.this wasn‚Äôt expected from #SAMSUNG.

Speaker and Sound 5/54. Battery 5/55. Performance 4/5. A common man can not trace out any negative point easily as this phone fulfils all his/her need that is needed by 80-90% of people. Remaining 10-20% would fall under techie category and they would not be satisfied by having sky in their hands too.6. OS Experience 5/5Cons:1. Little bit bulky compare to other phones. But, if your look at other pros then this tiny issue gets nullify.Verdict : Overall phone is very good and value for money. Whatever we paid we got it. No regret at all. Guys if you are a Samsung fan and want to go with 20K budget around, then trust me you would not be disappointed. So, no more thinking and worry ness anymore. Go for it, order and grab itüòä",

        "body": "HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",

        "body": "READ CAREFULLY!THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FROM ANY TIER ONE BRAND CONSIDERING THE PRICE! IT EVEN BEATS SUPERIOR CHINESE PHONES IN SEVERAL ASPECTS!After using the phone for almost 2 months here are all the pros and cons.Pros :1. The display is a super amoled HDR 10 panel with 420 nits of brightness and the display looks amazing. You'll find 90hz displays in this range but you won't get the actual display quality of this phone in any other phone.2. Battery life is too good! Easily lasts 1.5 days with heavy usage.3. Camera quality is awesome in any condition just not that great in night time auto mode. The dynamic range and color reproduction of the main sensor is amazing and also the wide angle camera is the best wide angle in this price! The macro lense is of 5mp unlike all the Chinese brands who gives only 2mp and the difference in quality is noticeable. Auto focus is very good too. The hyperlapse and night hyperlapse works very well and the quality is astonishing. Never used single take so don't care. But the slow mo and super slow mo is damn good and works quite well except some minor stutters in super slow mo. 4K video recording is available in both front and back and the quality is best in class with true to life colors and great dynamic range also EIS works on rear 4K recording so it looks pretty good. Then there comes super steady to take steady videos to the next level but the quality drops to FHD. Surprisingly you can shoot selfie videos in 1080p HDR which is I think first in that price. The front too is too good with great dynamic range and colors but lacks details sometimes. I can go on and on about the cameras on that phone. Samsung truly nailed it this time in that regard and no Chinese phone can beat that phone in this regard. Why it's so damn good? Because it's using sony imx682 for the rear cam and sony imx 616 for the front cam combined with Samsung's superior algorithm.4. THERE'S A COMPLETE PRO MODE IN THE CAMERA! Yes finally Samsung introduced it in M series and oh boy! It works too damn good! Just see my attached night time photos.5. One UI Core is very smooth and feature rich and the customizability and Samsung's revamped update policies makes this phone a no brainer.6. The look of the phone is gorgeous. You won't believe that this is just a plastic phone. And the bezels are so THIN which makes it look like a flagship phone. Also the punch hole cam is much better solution than any other out in the market. It doesn't distract when consuming media on that thing.7. The 25 watt super fast charger comes in the box and it does charge the with super fast speed which comes in handy when juicing up that large battery.8. 6GB RAM AND 128GB storage with micro sd slot and two active 4G SIM slot makes this phone very versatile and storage isn't a problem in that phone.9. Exynos 9611, the foundation of this phone is old and constantly gets trashed by the reviewers but tbh it performs every tasks quite well and the Mali G72 MP3 gpu on that phone is not that powerful but it can play many heavy games with quite good graphics and framerates and the phone doesn't heat up too much. Tbh this cpu and gpu combo is great for daily tasks and very good but not great for gaming. Performance of the phone is fast and fluid.10. There is no sensor missing from this phone unlike the olden days of samsung when they used to slack off so many sensors.11. The mono speaker in that phone is quite loud and clear and the output from that 3.5mm jack combined with dolby digital sound makes it a good sounding device.12. The side mounted fingerprint sensor is very reliable and fast. There is a secure face unlock too which works great for the most part.13. Cellular reception and call quality and wifi connection  is very good. No problems there.Now theCons :1. The build quality could have been better. The plastic back scratches easily. Even the gorilla glass 3 front screen scratches too with sharper things and duats. The plastic frame is intact with no scratches but the paint job could be chipped off in the long term usage. Only time will tell though.2. The skin smoothening of the camera is still there even after completely disabling it. It can be fixed with sw updates though.3. The adaptive brightness sensor utilizes too much battery as it's not a proper light sensor that is being used. It just uses the front cam which is not an efficient technique.4. There is no headphone, case and usb converter in the box.5. The auto HDR mode is bit finicky and it doesn't always gets applied to the photos as there is no \"always apply\" option available in the settings.6. The vibration motor is good but missing any kind of haptic feedbacks. Also the vibration doesn't work on the keyboard.7. There is no 60fps mode available in the camera.8. There is no nfc or mst so no samsung pay, no goodlock support, no full version knox so no secure folder, no bixby, exynos so no gcam support etc.9. Night mode doesn't work that great. But front night mode works pretty good.So these were my findings of that phone. Hope it helps in your purchase.",

        "body": "Dear friends, reviewing about this phone after using for 15 days now. The phone look, display and sound is very good and Samsung has really done justice at the given price and will give u an awesome buyer feel.But the camera quality is poor not as per the specifications given. U cant compare the pictures taken with a shot from an One plus Nord or even from an Iphone XR.. The worst part of the phone is the software and the apps given with the phone. The phone hangs a lot even after having 8gm Ram and 128 storageüò≠üò≠üò≠ Whatsapp doesn't works properly in terms of downloading and forwarding. Other apps also takes long time to open and not instant at all.The battery life and sound quality is very good . Battery after 100% stays for more than a day which is good. But what would u do with battery if phone keeps hanging and software doesn't responds well !!My suggestion is dont go for this phone rather go for A or S series phones.",

        "body": "I am writing this review after using the product for more than 2 months.Generally, mobile users prefer the following things. They areBattery LifeDisplayCamera and Picture QualityCall qualitySoundQuality of the productSo I am writing my review based on the aforementioned factors.Battery Life: Really good and I don't think any other product in this price segment matches this product. Those who prefer better battery life can obviously choose this product.Display: This phone will offer you the best display which you cant expect from other smartphones in this price segment.Camera Quality: Both front and rear cameras are extremely good at sunlight conditions. But the performance of the camera under low light is moderate and it needs to be improved.Call Quality: Neither so good nor bad. You can expect the quality of what the other branded cell phone offers.Sound: In the product specification they will tell like Dolby digital. But in reality, I don't find any difference in the sound quality and I am certain to say that those claims are fake and only for commercial purposes.Quality of the product: Here I mention the built quality. It is really good. But the biggest drawback is its processor (Exynos 9611). This is a very old processor and smartphones like Realme, Oppo, Vivo, and MI phones offer better processors in this price range.  This is how they managed to offer the phone at this price (At the cost of reducing the quality). I played some games like wildscapes without any issues. But as a computer professional, I would say the phone will certainly irritate you when you play games that demand more clock cycles. So, if you are a user who loves to play games with more graphics don't go for this product and you check the processor to suit your needs.Fingerprint sensors: I would say OK and not excellent. When you have little sweat or even a slight amount of water in your hand you need to try more times to unlock the device.So I prefer to suggest this product for those who do not use computationally intensive applications, love to take photographs and watch online movies. This phone is ideal for moderate and occasional users. The product would certainly disappoint those who spent more time with smartphones and love to play games with more graphics.  The choice is up to you.",

It got micro scratches from hard cover so you got the idea.And second is processor.It is not for heavy gaming.You also see some frame drops in day to day life but it is okey due to a very fine os.I am a xiomi user before,os experience is 100 times better.Otherwise it has best camera, best battery life, best screen , best os experience.So its a very fine phone.Finally no phone is perfect so don't expect it to be.",

And the fingerprint reader is the fastest i have used till now in any midrangers..., so just close your eyes and go for the monster...i prefer you the 6gb ram and 128 gb varient... it's enough for all task...and if you are a very heavy gamer then go for the 8gb ram varient.Thank You,Amaan Tanveer",

Service center initiated the replacement process in which a voucher shall be provided to the customer to buy a phone of same value from the retail store ONLY. Now, M31s is not available offline and I want to buy same handset again but Samsung does not have a solution to this. Have raised this issue in multiple forums like Samsung care thru' online chat, whatsapp, call, Facebook, Twitter etc. I would say Samsung has one of the worst response system towards customer complaints. How ridiculous is this policy where a customer is denied same handset as a replacement for the faulty one bought earlier.Guys, I switched from Apple to Samsung mainly bcz of the current movement of not buying Chinese brands as my iPhone got damaged after a loyal 4 years of use.It was one of the worst decision as Samsung India seems to be way behind in customer quality as compared to other brands.",

SoundSound output of mono speakers is good. Becomes too loud at full volume. Impressive.3. Camera (not explored all features yet)Full resolution photos are impressive.

After six days, the repair status on their website says that the service order is cancelled because warranty papers have not been received by them, which is absolutely rubbish because their Service Centre accepted the phone only after verifying the warranty details. Absolutely third rate service and phone by Samsung.",

I'll tell you why.Pros about the phone:Camera is very good at this priceS. Amoled display is off the chartsVery very good for normal useFinger print censors are very responsive and efficientCons:Even though I said camera is very good there is little problem with it. When you use the rear camera for video shooting, there is a little focusing problem. It is constantly changing the focus. But I already knew that seeing the other reviews. But if you're buying this phone for camera... well don't. I hope samsung will fix this with a update.This phone could've been used for more than \"normal\" use if the battery is as it is. Because I still don't feel like its a 6000mAh. It is still like a normal 4500mAh battery.I mean I don't even play games and still its like that and that's disappointing to be honest.There is no tpu case. Why dude why? It took me soo long to get a back cover for this phone and by that time there was some scratches in my phone. They really should've given a tpu case.The reason why I bought this phone is because I needed a non- Chinese phone under 20000. Or else by this time I would've bought m51. Overall its not a bad phone but its still not phone as I expected.",

Thats simply great when you have 6000mAh battery.4) Display - Amoled Display shows vivid colours. Videos,  Movies are great to be watched on M31S.5) UI - OneUI interface is simply superb.

Keep extra 10k ready with you if you're going for this phone coz warranty does not cover the super amoled display and they told it is a common thing for the blue dot to happen and cover the screen . They won't do it under warranty and will take money from you whatsoever and will also take 10-15 days for the service",

        "body": "I Bought M31s on 18th September and I'm satisfied with the product. This phone is great for those who don't play games often (yea coz of the generic Exynos chipset). But for light users, you don't have to worry about the performance (It's pretty much enough).The camera - Rear cam is great but... BUT the front camera doesn't give the feel like its 32MP, I was able to notice more noise in the images but in daylight with proper lighting the image comes pretty good (It's okay-ish still it could have been much better).The fingerprint reader is amazingly fast and you'll get used to it after using it for a day or two.The speakers are great!The Battery (which is the beast) got to be the best selling point for this phone. It charges from 0-100% in less than 2 hours (Many companies are reducing the charging hours, but ignore that fact coz this one is a monster) it took more than 24 hours for it to drain from 100% to 0% and if you are using it for just personal use then you can expect more than that (it came for about 28 hours for me I guess).Display is another amazing thing about M31s, It is obviously expected from Samsung to give the best display in industry.  But they could have increased the screen protection by giving Corning Gorilla glass 5 (I personally felt this) So while ordering the phone don't forget to order a temper too! And a back case, yeaaa coz the back is 'glastick' which looks glossy but it can break easily so back case is a must if you have butterfingers.The weight balancing is greatly done!!The Software experience is neat. One UI is great, you'll definitely love it..So if you are a heavy user or a selfie freak or someone who things protection is important or someone who wants super-super fast charging then this phone is not recommended for you.",

But in description it is mentioned that it'll take 90 mins to reach 100%. WhatsApp sticker installed can't be used/available in the dual WhatsApp app. On this price range, it doesn't fullfill my expectations.",

Ultra wide lens - 12MP - 123¬∞ field of view3. Macro lens - 5MP4. Live focus lens - 5MPPrimary camera takes beautiful crisp shots with excellent dynamic range provided ample amount of light. If doesn't disappoint me in night also! The ultra wide camera provides the same amount of color balance and dynamic range. The live focus provides good edge detection. So this is the most improved phone in the 'M' lineup of Samsung phones.Display:-This has a beautiful display with a dot nucth which doesn't interfere much. Therefore this has a good display tooFingerprint sensor:-This phone has a side mounted fingerprint sensor. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is excellent and I quite like it compares with my previous phones which has fingerprint sensor at the back, but one thing which disappoint me is that it won't work when you r hands have even the slightest amount of water or oil or any other thing.Conclusion:-This is not a perfect phone under 20,000/- but it is definitely one of the better phones for 20,000/-.",

Video stabalization is not that great as even minor shake cause a blurry output.Bixby vision and AR zone are too cool.Super Amoled display is a treat to watch,call quality is good,excellent battery,smart view option to mirror mobile screen is good. To conclude, M31s definately stands tall from samsung segment but if it would have been within 17k price range it would surely be one of the competative one in market.",

Samsung should provide features like Samsung Pass in this phone.Panel is made of plastic. It get scratches very easily. One has to apply back cover to avoid this.No water resistant rating provided or mentioned.M30, M30s, M31, M31s all have same processor i.e.  Exynos 9611, which is based on 10nm. On other hand many cheaper phones are using 8nm processors which is more efficient. Samsung is charging good amount of money for some incremental changes.",

For those who are looking for a battery life its a huge disappointment.Two major disappointments:1. Since the phone is new in the market, Samsung should have provided a better experience with One UI 2.5 or 3.0. But there seems to be no plans for the UI upgrade.2. I am a heavy user and the only reason for buying the phone was the massive 6000mah battery. But it seems to be a pretty much disappointment from Samsung. I have been using the phone for a week now and the battery does not perform as expected. I don't play games on the phone but daily uses like Paytm, google pay, Teams, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp. The battery does not long even for 8-9 hours. I am sure that it is a paid promotion from the vloggers that they mention about the 2-day battery life. I was expecting the phone to be charged every 2 days, but I have to charge the phone every day. If I want to have a 2-day battery then I have to use very cautiously like not using wifi, WhatsApp, or any sort of heavy use.",

        "body": "#UNBIASED CUSTOMER REVIEWI was looking to buy a new phone since 4-5 months under 20000. Writing the review after using it for 40-Days(i Will write points which are not covered in those YouTube unboxing Videos)1. My initial requirement was an Amoled display(trust me it does make a lot of difference and is a lot better then those IPS displays. Additionally people in paid review also say that its will work fine but why to compromise?? you are paying for it)2. I wanted a Sony sensor which is a lot better than other 64MP/48MP sensor brands(for comparison please refer to YouTube videos)3. My third requirement was a rectangle/horizontal camera design and Neutral colors for phone's body.  Few Chinese origin companies are manufacturing PINK body( Phone should look classy. I think they should invest more in R&D and customer choices. Pink phone seriously?)4. A Decent processor since as i am not really a hard core gamer.5. A non- Chinese preferred-India manufactured preferred.FINAL VERDICT AFTER USING IT FOR 40 DAYSI . I Have literally checked out every single phone in the price range and nothing looked better than M31s.It Gives me 24 hours of backup even after using it for whole day.( Mild gaming, heavy Youtube, Google meet/zoom sessions)II. Camera is awesome specially primary sensor and Macro sensor + vlogging mode while video recording. crystal clear images as well as videos. Also it doesn't take makes your photos look OVER SATURATED AND CARTOONY which happen with all the Chinese brands. See the image of Tulsi leaf i have clicked from its 64 MP Sony IMX 682 primary sensor, The second image is just a cropped form of the same 1st image and you can see the thorns on the edge of the Tulsi leaf.III. Build quality is awesome feels premium, people notice it. Call quality is crisp and clearIV. AT LAST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW - THE PROCESSOR: Since last 40 days i am using M31s and my usage is - Mild Pubg, cod and clash of clan and Asphalt + Handling heavy office documents + multi tasking + playing 4K videos and so on. And till now it hasn't hanged, not even a single time, works smooth like a butter Thanks to Samsung's Software Optimization and R&D wing. Of course if you are a heavy gamer who invests  6+  hours in gaming and requires highest quality gaming experience then this phone is not for you i will suggest you to invest more and go for Gaming phones(35k+).V. KNOX SECURITY IS INCLUDEDCons-1. No screen recording (fix it by downloading 3rd party app)2. I couldn't get Mirage black color due to it's unavailability during the launch day.I was looking for a phone since Feb 2020 and have literally tried every phone but none was Perfect for the price range available. They offer a lot of things on paper but in reality its a hoax. Just go for M31s if you have the same requirements as mentioned above you won't regret it.#UNBIASED CUSTOMER REVIEW",

Camera is really impressive, especially the macro lens4. Ergonomics are good. Weight balance has been done well.5. Sound quality is very good despite having single speaker. It is loud and has good bass.6. No heating issue under normal usage and video streaming.Cons:1. Battery backup not as per expectation mainly due to the dated processor. While doing battery drain test, it performs at par with phones with 4500mah battery with Snapdragon 720G/730G processors2. Despite having 25w charger, 0-100% takes more than 2.5 hours to get fully charged (if your mobile is switched on).3. Dated Processor: This mobile is not for gamers. Processor is dated and might slow down in a year or two. Moreover, this processor might not be compatible with Samsung's future UIs4. Display might not withstand a drop due to Corning glass 3 and heavy weight of the phone5. Competition offers better value for money phones. Realme 7 pro scores better in almost all aspects (65 watt charger, stereo speakers, faster and more efficient processor, battery life almost same as M31s, light weight, look wise more appealing)Conclusion:Considering the current competition, if you want to stick to Samsung, then spend some more money and go for M51 which is much better equipped than M31s (more powerful and power efficient processor, accommodates larger battery by increasing weight by only 10 gms, phone will last 3-4 hours more than M31s, better and larger display, charging time will be almost at par with M31s due to better and optimized processor, may support future UIs and android updates).Alternatively, look for Realme 7pro which offers much better specs and experience at same price of M31s.",

On moderate use this snartphone can hild upto 24-26 hrs and in extreme use the battry can last upto 16-18 hrs which is again great.This smartphone has 6.5 inches SUPER AMOLED + infinity o display which guves vivid colors which looks colorful and gives amazing emersive viewing experiance.Now, the most controversual part is its processor. This smartphone has Exynos 9611 processor which is alright in daily and moderate use. If you are extreme user then this smartphone can show little lag.This snartohobe has 32 MP front camera which is infinity o punch hole in the center. The rear camera has 64MP quad rear camera with a 64 MP sony IMX sensor in it.Overall at the price of under 20,000 this smartphone is best of all nad can be used very nicely.",

        "body": "I have been using this phone for a month now (6gb ram, 64gb rom variant) and here is my review:1. Build: The build is entirely plastic but does not feel cheap in hand. The gradient design at the back makes it real cool.2. Screen: The screen is one of the brightest and vivid. The colors come out really well and don‚Äôt  make the phone appear as a budget phone anytime. The media viewing is actually awesome.3. Battery: I take around 50-60 calls in a day; watch media for 2-3 hours. The battery lasts me the entire day (8am-9pm) and then I have to put it on charge again with 20% battery still remaining. The charger provided is 25w which takes almost 1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.4. Camera: The cameras are really good, especially the output from the primary on the rear one. The pictures are bright with good details in daylight. I also find the night mode to be better than most other phones at this budget. The selfie snapper is 32 mp with good images in daylight; the images appear soft and grainy in low light however.5. Software and performance: This is where the lag comes into play. The device is powered by a age-old exynos processor. I have felt stutters while using apps like youtube and whatsapp. When I minimise the youtube window and again go back to reopen it, sometimes I get only the audio with no video playing. Similarly sometimes whatsapp freezes while I try to take a picture. However, I think these are minor issues and can be fixed through software updates. All other apps run well. I am not a heavy gamer but games like subway surfers, ninja warrior run without any lags.6. Network and call: I have noticed many call drops and voice issues. The 4g connectivity is also not very stable (I use airtel). These again can be addressed through software updates.Overall it is a great budget phone with few software issues. This is the phone for you if you are on a budget of less than 20,000 bucks and a light to moderate user.",

This phone is not for heavy usage as the processor is a bit old.No severe heating issues comes, heat a bit, when watching movies for long hours.Due to large battery, phone is a bit on heavier side. The back is slippery, so if back cover is not used, it may simply slip from your side pocket (and due to heaviness it may damage the screen) , as it did in my case.If you are a mild to medium user, who need good camera, screen and battery go for this, you will never regret.",

If you are a business user or using it with normal apps then this is a great option for you.3. The OneUI is very good i can say because it has lot of customisation and very decent to look at.4. Transparent cover is not included so you have to go for other brand cases.5. Phone is handy as it's not that big in size.6. Type C fast charger is there with two sided type C which will help you with reverse charging and can use with laptop having type c port.",

        "body": "This is my first SAMSUNG Smartphone which I ordered on 8th Sept and received very quickly on the 12th even it was a village address. Kudus to the Amazon delivery.Though the M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it‚Äôs good for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during a normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago‚Ä¶ (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues with battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super AMOLED display‚Ä¶..All these Chinese brand phones though have good Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super AMOLED display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display‚Ä¶..there is a day and night difference‚Ä¶.So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super AMOLED display and sony sensor‚Ä¶in Samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor‚Ä¶btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625‚Ä¶.Its super power-efficient and smooth for day-to-day tasks and heavy multitasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will at least match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am‚Ä¶. was delivered on 8th Aug‚Ä¶..first impression is very good especially the camera‚Ä¶ excellent super AMOLED display‚Ä¶.even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super AMOLED display‚Ä¶.built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame‚Ä¶.but can‚Äôt b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality‚Ä¶.. anyways how many of us use mobile without case‚Ä¶..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S‚Ä¶......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a good successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100, it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had the same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is good‚Ä¶.it's fast but u need to touch it correctly‚Ä¶.but I am getting used to side-mounted fingerprint‚Ä¶it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies are excellent-provided there is enough artificial light‚Ä¶. without much light it‚Äôs avg like any other mid-range phone‚Ä¶.if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like what normally redmi and realme back cameras do‚Ä¶.I am not a gamer‚Ä¶..for normal apps and multi-tasking there is no delay at all‚Ä¶.hope in the long run it remains the same‚Ä¶I am still a little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months‚Ä¶.but this processor is tried and tested by Samsung in many phones so hoping for the best‚Ä¶",
