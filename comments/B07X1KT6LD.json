        "body": "Worst phone ever. Wasted my money. I am writing this review after 7 months of use. I have been using redmi phones since last 4 years. Earlier phones were good, that's why bought this one. But this time totally waste of money. Now this brand can't be trusted anymore. Fake Chinese product.1. Fingerprint sensor doesn't work well. You have to touch sensor for long time to unlock the device.2. Camera is not good. Quad camera is just for show off. Other brand cameras are quite better. Front camera is normal.3. Battery backup is worst. Battery gets drained within 3-4 hours of normal use(not playing games, just whatsApp and FB). Charger is also fake and not fast charging. It's normal charger and takes around 3 hours to full charge.4. The worst part is that when I unlock the device, always a black screen appears with a message \"Don't cover the earphone area\", even if I am not touching the phone area. The picture of the message is attached here. It's very irritating and sometimes I feel like crushing the phone with a hammer. Most of time during whatsApp call, there is complete black screen and the phone gets hanged and the call has to be disconnected as nothing works.This problem started within 3-4 months of use and it has become more frequent now. I thought the problem will be solved after update but nothing happened. Now I am frustrated with the problem and want to resolve the problem soon but don't know what to do. Does the warranty cover such issues? I want repair or replacement of the phone.Worst phone ever. Will never buy this brand in future again. Worthless Chinese product.",

I think this company is defeating the objective of customer satisfaction by delivering this defective phones to the innocent customers.

Like suddenly starts opening and closing tabs usually during outdoors. Also hasa bug on notification bar as it gets vanished sometimes while multitasking and you can oy get it back when you go to previous app which was opened. So frustrating. Speakers are low. As expected.Pros:HandyNice design. Gives premium look.Main camera gives good performance during outdoors or daylight.Doesn't hang much. Not on daily task.128 GB!I wish Xiaomi could troubleshoot this issue online but no help received. They'll ask u to go to service center and eventually they will request u to keep the phone for 2 days so that they can format and install new software. Honestly I can't go this long so yeah I'm dealing it by myself and probably gonna sell this after warranty.",

Nice camera quality but it does not support stickers in camera which is not at all a good feature. Battery life is excellent as I can 5-6 online classes very easily with full battery charged. Fingerprint reader works excellent and very quickly. It consumes a lot of data as in my realme phone it consumes just half data,means in redmi note 8 after completing my all online classes oy consumes 2 gb of data while in my realme phone it consumes only 1 gb of data. This phone supports a lot of suitable features which impressed me a lot. At last but not the last I would say that this phone is not appropriate for the students who do a lot of online classes and is a excellent phone for the people who loves to play online games such as 'Garena Free Fire','Pub-G' and 'Call of duty'.",

        "body": "Is it still worth in 2020??I was trying to buy the Note 9 but thanks to the so called SALE..I could not be lucky to get one. So I decided to go for this. Almost same specifications on paper and just a difference of battery size, so I thought if giving it a try.Wow...I really liked the design....Glass on both side and the colour gradient at the back really makes a look worth.There is a triple slot for 2 sim and a memory. Ir blaster present. Secondry mic and volume rockers. Fingerprint sensor placed at back. So from outside it's all worth the price. But the real story is placed inside. So let's jump in.Performance is media core and high end gamers are advised to stay away. 4gb ram is good for normal games and day to day operation. Phone is not hanging -atleast as of now.Battery can give you whole day juice provided you are a normal user. If you are a power user., You will have to charge by 3 pm. No heating issue noticed. Now the camera. And I am disappointed with the 48mp performance. The colours look dull and moved. Low light performance is absolute terrible. Flash will make your photo pale yellow. So totally unsatisfied. Selfie camera is good but specially me don't like that extra powder on the face. Video was satisfactory however not that stable.My conclusion is not for you but for the company. Make two phones ina year but make sure they have good hardware's, it's of no use to change model by keeping all the same specs and just changing a part. I was not at all happy with this dull player specially the camera part.",

According to me Moonlit white is the best and standard colour for this phone compared to other fancy ones#Camera is good for the price( I would say one of the best after a weeks use..added some sample pics with this including a wide angle photo 😍)Cons#(I had mentioned slow charging issue, but never experienced it again and charge lasts for more than a day on moderate use)I dont use finger print sensor and is not commenting on that.

Fingerprint and face unlock are super fast.2. The touch is smooth but could be smoother.3. Beautiful colors are available, I am using Neptune Blue.4. Feel and Look is just awesome.5. The notch is small which is great.6. RAM and Internal Memory are quite good at this price point.7. The processor is super fast.8. Build quality is good.Cons:1. While watching videos, screen quality seems to have degraded a lot. While performing other actions, the screen looks quite good.2. The temperature of the device reaches an abnormal temperature after 30-40 minutes of gaming.3. IPS Display which is HDR Enabled is not up to the mark.4. The camera is not up to the mark.Though anyone can opt for this device, despite these cons as it as an overall beast in this price segment.",

A lot of us use our phones as hotspot in these COVID times when WiFi is down. I keep it right next to my laptop when using it as hotspot but battery drains really quickly.3. Picture quality from GCAM gets improved to some other level. Better install GCAM to take full advantage of cameras.4, As it has Corning Gorilla Glass on both front and back, so, always use it with protection on both sides otherwise you will fall in trouble very soon.5. Somehow Data Network is not working properly for me. I could be an issues specific to my phone but when I use the same SIM in a different phone data network works as per expectations. Strange!",

This price of this phone has increased from that of its release price,earlier it was 11k for64/4 but I got it for 12k on amazon and since I exchanged old phone i got for 10k. This phone is gorgeous,espically the black colour it looks very classy. My earlier phone was a redmi too.Even thot ppl blame chinese products, redmi gives ppl something which samsung can't even dream about. Go for it without doubt. Awesome phone. The display is so good. The back panel is glasssy and classy. The phone is light weight and can be handled with one hand easily bcoz even i was worried about this enormous phone size bcoz i was using note 3 earlier wic was just 5'5 inches so uprading to 6+ was big worry for me bcoz my hand is smaller size but its just so comfortable with one hand too. The drop notch is something new for me and very cool features. Took 9-10 days for delivery but was worth the wait for sure. Earlier i had decided to but redmi note 9 pro but after reading the horrible reviews about ppl on amazon i went with a older n much appreciated model that is note 8. Its a versatile phone for sure. Thanks amazon. The process of exchange was smooth",

Since all brands raised price so purchased this by paying 2000 extra. Since launching price is 10k. Now it's 12k. On exchanging realme 1 got this. It's ok mobile. Nothing better.",

Looks quite premium as GG5 on front and back. A bit slippery so You need a case.3. In this particular price range, Processor is fine. Pubg in medium Setting works great. Even Fortnite can run smoothly on medium settings.Cons:-1. The main problem is bettery. Though it has big battery but it drains very often even in watching videos for long. Need to fix this in updates.2. Two out of 10 times Device gets heated a bit while Playing games. Needs an game optimization update for hard gaming.You can go for it. In this particular price range, It's a beast. :)",

Heat 44° for charging till 90.after charging slows and heating vanishs. Hot atmosphere gaming results in 47° heat. So don't game outside. Extremely touch sensitive. Best inevitable part is miui, it unlock great features u should find out.Anyway Buy it, because this one worth it.",

It's a nice phone, the battery works for a day completely in normal usage, the camera is very good with the advantage of having multiple lenses like ultrawide, macro and depth sensor. While my phone variant is 4GB ram still works fine with some games I play. The fast charger 18w is another advantage at this price range. Overall as of my experience it's a great phone with this price. 🙂😊The only cons I found is; Only if the battery was 5000mah it would be very good, and if the back camera was little down to phone body (since it's a little bit stretched outside) it would be perfect.",

Thus you can't uninstall those apps. However, in some apps, you can disable these ads. But in rest of the apps, you have to live with these annoying ads.At a price of 14k+ , these are no more 'budget' phones. And if not budget phones, why push so much of ads?The in-built Yellow Pages app is something similar to True Caller App.  This Yellow Pages app syncs your contacts with their server without your consent or permission. This is rather breach of privacy, xaomi!Camera is average and all Megapixels and quality shown in promotions is just an extrapolated. The camera setup inherently doesn't offer 48Mp images.",
