Its best for elderly people or if using it as a secondary phone for calls and texts. Nokia could have offered dual sim at this price point (₹1200) that would have made it the most value for money. But can't expect much at this price. It arrived completely dead but was up and running after a charge. Delivery was super fast. Got this delivered in just one day (non-prime user).

Very bad performance.  I want to return this faulty piece.  Let me be frank, I strongly would say, most of the vendors on amazon are selling faulty/defective or error some products.

        "body": "My grandparents have had a great experience with Nokia handsets. Good battery life, durable, good sound quality. That's all my grandma needed and it served the purpose. Of course these were purchased offline and at a time when smartphones were not dirt cheap.Guess now Nokia doesn't make em as they used to or inferior/faulty devices are being sold online.The day she received it, the call volume was low at her end but it was okay. But at the other end there was static. We tried different sims, different locations but still the same. Day 3 the call volume went down drastically and she couldn't hear a thing. She could hear if she tried really hard and pressed the phone against her ear.Totally disgusted by the product as it has been a nightmare for my grandparents during these tough times to get this phone working and no other means to contact.Being a prime member I assured them that the phone could be replaced if there were any problems but for some reason pick up wasn't available and they had to send the device back. I couldn't ask them to do that. It's harrasment and sending it through courier is next to impossible for those old souls.Very very disappointed. Never expected this from Amazon. Cannot rely on the service when I really need them.",

My super expensive smartphone died again in 2 years and I decided not to buy a smartphone anymore as long aas I had an alternative. I knew my Jio sim wouldn't wrk on this phone so I had to buy a new Airtel 4g sim.Data doesn't work n this phone,but my old phone with the dead screen is running with its hotspot on and I've paid upfront r the full year.I'm getting ued to the dumb phone again and actually liking it. No updates o no slowing down of phone. Supports call blocking but not sms which I miss.Takes a full size sim card. No way to backup contacts so I've been saving the contacts to sim. Miss Google contacts sync.Only downside is that battery is pathetic. I don't touch the phone through the day except for my morning conference call with office and occasionally a one hour long call in the evening. Battery lasts only 3 days. Overall happy to be rid of my smartphone.",

        "body": "I bought this phone for my sister. Reviewing it after one week.Cons:1. The plastic body is of very poor quality. It is like a plastic toy.2. Phone is very bad in features. Even basic things are not covered.I have been using Samsung ET 1200 for an year and it has way lot of features than this like-There is no timer or stopwatch. It is there generally in every basic phone. Only alarm is there that also u have to fill it daily. there is no option like repeat everyday.U can only save one number under one name. If a contact has more than one number, u have to create a new contact to save that with a different name.There is no option to turn off the keypad light.No option to increase the font size. Font size in messages is pretty small. If you are planning to buy for anold aged person, please don't.Only dialed numbers appear in call button. If you want to check a miss call or received call u need to go in menu than select call logs.No optipns at all for ringtones, message tones, wallpapers etc.Pros:Fm is there.There are 3-4 games. Which is good for a basic phone.Overall, After using 2 basic phones I think samsung et-1200 in this range is much ahead in features and usability.",

I guess the quality has dropped so bad that Nokia doesn't even check their products these days.Anyways what do you expect from a phone costing 1100/- rupees.But overall for the price the phone is okay for a use and throw phone. Buttons are tiny and closely spaced esp the center navigation button. Nokia has now in this model placed the left right up down and select button under the same keypad button. If you have fat fingers, it gets annoying to navigate and select. Not user friendly for old people because of the  keypad button spacing. Otherthan that for the price the phone is not bad, you cant expect much ..",

        "body": "I bought this as a secondary phone for my  office sim. The phone is very light weight and you wont even feel it is there in the pocket. But the build quality is not good. There is some vibration during calls. The audio quality is not good. Volume is low. At the top there is a led light, earphone out and micro usb charging port. The led light has no use as the light is not bright. Even light in a 10 rupee cigar lighter has more brightness than this. The micro usb port and led light is placed near, and I always end up trying to insert the usb cable in the led light. The buttons are also not good. The navigation cum selection key works erratically. When I press the OK key usually the Up key is pressed. The phone wont lock automatically. You need to manually lock it. Unlocking is very easy that even my 3 year child always opens it by pressing randomly. There are some games and only one is free. For others you need to pay Rs.99 which will be deducted from your phone balance as sms. So be very careful. Overall this is a very basic phone and do not expect that old Nokia quality.",

It had away better design and features.But there's not much choice is this segment, and Nokia is obviously the king at least of the feature phone arena",

Howver samsung 1200 charging input is different so you have to always carry samsung charger with samsung 1200.2. No FM in samsung 12003. Its nokia. Nokia is great in basic phones.",
